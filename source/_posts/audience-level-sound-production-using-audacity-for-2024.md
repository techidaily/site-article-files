## 2\. Recording using Mac

To record audio on your Mac, you might need to install Audacity and additional plugins. The best option is to use the Soundflower program, which enables you to send sound to other apps rather than your computer's speakers. Here's how to use Soundflower and Audacity to record audio on a Mac.

Step1The first step is to install Soundflower and Audacity on your Mac. It costs nothing to download either of these programs.

Step2The Soundflower app must then be set up. To achieve this, choose "Sounds" from the "System Preferences" menu. By choosing the Output tab, designate "Soundflower" as the sound output device (2ch). After that, launch the Sunflower app, and select the Flower icon in the menu bar to switch the built-in output to "Soundflower 2ch."

Step3In the "Device" section of the Audacity preferences box, choose "Soundflower (2ch)". From the recording area, choose "Software playthrough." Click "OK" to save the options you've selected.

Step4Launch audacity, then open the app whose audio you wish to record. To begin the recording, click the "Record" button.

## 3\. Export your audio

It's time to export the finished file after finishing up your Audacity project's modification. It's crucial to realize that simply saving your Audacity project doesn't produce a file that you can share with others.

You'll need to do a process known as exporting in order to produce a file that you can distribute and publish to your podcast host, Spotify, or other audio distribution sites. Fortunately, everything is quite easy. Let's examine Audacity's exporting procedure.

Do the following in Audacity to export audio:

1. Activate the file menu
2. Then click "Export"
3. Choose the solution that best suits your needs

There are already preset options for. MP3,.WAV, and OGG files. If you require any of them, go ahead and choose the appropriate choice.

You can select from a variety of additional file formats, including FLAC, M4A, WMA, and more, if you select the "Export Audio..." option. But for these, you might need to install FFMPEG as mentioned in this article.

Simply select the necessary file format from the drop-down box that appears next to "Save as type:" In a moment, we'll delve deeper into some of the advanced settings.
