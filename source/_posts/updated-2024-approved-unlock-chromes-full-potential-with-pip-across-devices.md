## Part 4\. How to Fix Picture-In-Picture Mode Not Working

Picture in Picture allows you to watch videos while using other apps on your device. However, you may face challenges while using PIP on your computers. Both hand mobile phones and desktop computers may draw concerns with executing Picture-in-Picture because of different reasons.

### Mobile

If your Picture-in-Picture feature doesn't work even after following all the above steps to the end, there are two methods to fix such difficulties.

1. Clear Cache Memory of the YouTube App
2. Enable Picture-in-Picture mode on your device

2. In the list of Apps, go to **YouTube > Storage**
3. Tap the **Clear Cache** button then restart your phone

1. Go to **Settings > Apps & Notifications** on your phone
2. Tap **Advance > Special App Access > Picture-in-Picture**

1. Open **YouTube**
2. Go to **Settings > General**
3. Verify if Picture-in-Picture is disabled to enable this PIP feature on your phone.

Another concern comes when PIP is not available in your country. There are two ways to solve this. Using a web browser or VPN. Chrome enables you to use PIP even in countries where it is not enabled.
