Step 2: Once it is installed, open it and when asked to sign in, choose “Facebook” as your sign-in option.

Step 3: You will then be redirected to the camera app so you can shoot a video. To use an existing video, select the Gallery icon and select a video you already have. It will open.

Step 4: Select the section of the video that you would like to loop and convert into a boomerang. This app also gives you the option to remove the audio or replace it with something new.

Step 5: Once you are happy with all the selections that you have made, tap on the “Loop it” button at the top-right corner to create your boomerang.

The video will be saved directly to your device and you can then share it on social media platforms.

If you have a Samsung device, you can easily create a boomerang video in the Samsung Gallery app. Here’s how to do it;

Step 1: Open and video using the Samsung Gallery app.

Step 2: Tap “Play Video” and you should see a GIF icon at the top. Tap on this icon

Step 3: To create the boomerang effect, tap on “1.0x” to change the video playback speed.

Step 4: Then use the slider to trim the video to the desired length and then tap on the “Forward” arrow twice to add a back-and-forth effect.

## Related FAQs About Boomerang Maker

****Is there a limit on the Size of the Boomerang Video?**

Although you can technically create a boomerang video that is as long as you want, the length of the video you can make may be limited by the boomerang maker that you choose to use. You may also find that longer boomerang videos lose their effect after a while and therefore we recommend sticking to shorter looped videos that are much easier to share online, particularly on social media platforms.

****Can You Make a Boomerang Video Using an Exiting Video?**

Yes. Most solutions allow you to use an exciting video to create a boomerang video. But it is important to note that sometimes you may want to shoot a video that you can then use to create a boomerang video and therefore you should choose a tool that will allow you to do both. It is also worth pointing out that some tools are easier to use than others and you want to pick a solution that simplifies the process.

****What is the Best Way to Make a Boomerang Video?**

The best tool that you can use to create a boomerang video for any purpose is Wondershare Filmora. This is because not only will you easily loop the video to create the boomerang effect, but you can also use its numerous effects and features to embellish the video as much as you want. Since you can export the video in numerous different formats, it can be used to create videos for all sorts of purposes.
