### **Steps To Use Windows Movie Maker 6.0:**

Step1 All of the files that may be dragged and dropped into the timeline or storyboard to make a film are shown in the Imported Media folder. It's crucial to remember that before files may be utilized in any video production, they must first be imported into this folder. A video that you envision may be made by importing images, movies, and music.

Step2 By selecting the "Add movies and photographs" option from the "Home" page of the navigation bar, you may mix images, sound, and video to create films. You'll see a window where you may choose the material you want to import into the program. Either a single item or a selection of files may be uploaded simultaneously.

Step4 Windows Movie Maker 6 does come with a lot of brand-new transitions and effects. Among other things, you may split and change the pace of the imported video to create humorous or scary slow-motion or high-speed situations. Additionally, you may modify the music video to synchronize the visual and sound perfectly. Turn up the music's volume, let it fade out gradually, and create the ideal setting.

Step5 When your film is finished, sharing it online will be a breeze thanks to Windows Movie Maker's ability to instantly submit your video to Facebook, YouTube, and other social networks. The Publish Video wizard is pretty familiar but has a few additional choices when you publish an altered movie to the computer. Only Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate versions have HD support.
