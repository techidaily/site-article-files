If you need **unlimited cloud storage** with many features, then you could rely on OpenDrive. Indeed, OpenDrive is versatile cloud storage for personal use. It offers **unlimited cloud**, mirror-image backups, and web, desktop, or mobile app access. It also has useful features such as Zoho Docs, which enables the creation of documents and other file kinds within the app. Additionally, you will be amazed by its retention term, which is three times longer than competing services.

Furthermore, the price is one of the best things regarding OpenDrive. At only $9.95 per user each month, the Personal Unlimited plan is pretty cheap. Also, it doesn't have a minimum number of users. Hence, it is good if you don't have anyone to split the bill with.

Meanwhile, Zero-knowledge encryption is one of the most popular security features for online storage, and OpenDrive has it., OpenDrive will create a folder called "secure files." The AES 256-bit encryption protects all the files you put in this folder. You can also create sync and backup tasks in this folder.

### 2\. Icedrive

Icedrive just started up in 2019, making it the youngest cloud storage on this list. Nevertheless, it has quickly become one of the best services out there because it started out with zero-knowledge encryption and low prices.

If you use Windows, you can use Explorer to look through your storage space and do things like move, rename, open, and even edit files, just like you would on a local drive. Meanwhile, a custom app for Windows, Mac, and Linux goes even further, letting you browse files, preview documents, and stream your media files with a built-in player without having to download it

The price of Icedrive is probably the best thing about it. If 1TB of storage feels like enough space to you, then $4.17 per month for the annual basis is probably the best deal you can find. Icedrive also has subscriptions for a lifetime for $13.86, which can be a good choice if you plan to use your storage for a long time.

Google Drive, part of Google Workspace, is one of the best-unlimited cloud storage you can use for your business. When you use Google Workspace, you get Google Drive and all the tools that are part of Google workspace, such as Gmail, Meet, Keep, Calendar, Chat and the full suite of office software.

In terms of security, Dropbox has gotten a lot better over time. It has 256-bit AES encryption at rest, 128-bit AES encryption in transit, and two-factor authentication, and you can even wipe your device remotely if it gets stolen.

Flickr does have a free plan, but users can only post up to 1000 photos. Given that most of us take pictures daily, this doesn't seem like a very generous offer. If you want unlimited storage, you'll need to upgrade to Flickr Pro, which costs money. Therefore, you can subscribe monthly for $8.49 or annually for $80.04\. If you join the annual plan, you gain access to amazing bonuses, such as two free months of Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.

Flickr Pro includes limitless storage space and is compatible with iOS, Android, and PC web browsers. In addition, Flickr permits the upload of JPEG, PNG, and non-animated GIF files but not RAW images, which may be disappointing to professional photographers.

If this limitation does not bother you, Flickr's additional features compensate for it. One of its coolest features is the AutoUploader uploading tool, which allows you to upload a collection of photos from multiple sources. Moreover, Flickr, like many commercial websites, uses SSL/TLS, the small green lock next to a browser's URL address bar, to create a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher AES encryption, making sure that communication between your devices and Flickr is safe.

### Is Cloud Storage Safe?

Most cloud storage providers encrypt your data before it is delivered to their servers, and many also keep your data in an encrypted format. Nevertheless, no system is entirely safe, and cloud storage servers can be compromised. As a prevention, you can set two-factor authentication with cloud storage services. When you log in, you'll need to use a code sent to your phone as an SMS message or made by an authenticator app.
