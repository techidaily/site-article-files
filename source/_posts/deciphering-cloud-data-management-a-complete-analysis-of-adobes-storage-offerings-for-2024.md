### 3\. What is the Creative Cloud All Apps plan?

More than 20 creative apps, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, InDesign, and Audition, are a part of the Creative Cloud All Apps subscription plan.

### 4\. Do you need an internet connection to use Adobe Creative Cloud desktop app?

No. However, your computer must have the software to use the desktop apps in **Adobe Creative Cloud storage**, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Consequently, you can utilize them without a constant Internet connection.

The initial installation and licensing of your apps both require an Internet connection. Every 30 days, the desktop programs attempt to verify your software licenses.
