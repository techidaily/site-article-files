## Part 4 Rules Of WhatsApp Status You Should Know

By using the WhatsApp status feature, you will get an opportunity to share different types of media files, such as – video, image, GIF, and text as well. The main factor about this status feature is that it will be visible for 24 hours only. Even it is a public sharing method but the WhatsApp still keeps the complete procedure protected with end-to-end encryption.

If you want to receive or send updates regarding WhatsApp status, both ends should have each other’s contact saved in the contact book of the phone.

### How To Create And Send A Status Update?

##### Step1 Firstly, you should access the WhatsApp application and open the STATUS tab

##### Step2 In the status tab, you can see two major options; text and camera. In case you want to share something textual, you should click on the text icon and create the status. In the text, you can also use GIFs and Emojis. By using the symbol T feature, you can change the color of the font

In case you are interested in sharing any kind of media file; like – images, videos, or GIFs from internal storage, you should consider the camera icon. You can click the fresh image or record a new video as well.

##### Step3 After creating the status by selecting a media file or adding text, you can proceed by clicking the SEND button. Now it is shared on the status and available for your contacts to see for a period of 24 hours

![ Upload Your WhatsApp Status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/add-music-wa-7.png)

When it comes to sharing video content in the status, you should keep one thing in mind. WhatsApp supports only two video formats to share and these are mpeg4 and 3GP.

### Final Words

These are the complete details that can help you figure out how to add music to WhatsApp story and upload it. Along with methods and procedures, you will also understand the WhatsApp rules for sharing or uploading status. If you are interested in working with a video editor, you should be careful while choosing one. Before making a final decision, it will be good to focus on testimonials and some other aspects.
