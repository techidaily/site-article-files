Apple M1 Pro reviews state that it is far better than M1 chips in performance, speed, capacity, battery life, quality, and processing.

Apple M1 Pro provides 70 percent more processing speed and performance than M1\. Here are Apple M1 pro specs, price, and release details. So that you will have a good idea about what Apple M1 Pro does and how it is better than the previous version.

### Section 1: Apple M1 Pro Specifications & Performance

Before going through any other information, it is pretty essential to understand the performance level of the Apple M1 Pro chip, not the part of the MacBook Pro system. So that if you are planning to own it or if it is not yet configured to your system, you can upgrade it to M1 Pro accordingly.

Below is mentioned the Apple M1 Pro specification details to provide you with a better perspective of the M1 Pro chip and its performance.

* **GPU:** 16 cores
* **CPU:** 10 cores (8 performance cores, 2 efficiency cores), 8 cores for 14 inches
