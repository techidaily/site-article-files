## Part 2: 10 Helpful Tips to Use VSCO Photo Editor

In this section, we will enlist 10 helpful tips through which you can build amazing VSCO edits without wasting your time unnecessarily. Are you seeking a similar thing? Read the following tips carefully and get ready to share alluring images with the world:

### 1\. Makes Adjustments

Before starting with editing your picture, the first rule is to crop the picture by making appropriate pictures. Make sure that the angle of your photo is correct and straight by removing the unwanted edges and objects from the frame. Your subject should be at the center so that it can instantly catch a viewer's attention. You can do this entire process manually or automatically on the VSCO Photo Editor.

![vsco crop tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vsco-photo-editor-2.jpg)

### 2\. Control the Light Exposure

Light exposure is the other significant element of the picture as a perfect light exposure draws attention and seems pleasant to the eyes. Many times, individuals capture photos in daylight or in a room where the light exposure is minimum. If your subject is not illuminated perfectly, you can effectively control the light exposure through the VSCO Photo Editor.
