## Do You Really Need an HDMI 2.1 Monitor?

To be frank, talking about the monitor itself, few companies and factories are making these monitors at the moment, but a rising trend can be seen without a doubt. So at the start point of this new HDMI tech, we can say that it is still far from the market's mainstream. Prices are high; choices are limited.  

On the other hand, talking about games, say you're buying this for your next-gen gaming console, consider now most games are 4K 60hz or 1080p 120hz. It is still far from what Sony and Microsoft promise.  

But if you're not a price-sensitive consumer or you are a geek, here is our choice of the top 6 HDMI 2.1 monitors you can find in 2024.

## Top 6 Best HDMI 2.1 Monitors

#### 1. Gigabyte AORUS FV43U

With a 1ms Response time, this monitor is the first and foremost "special" monitor, which means that you will not experience any visual delay while taking part in any game - giving you pixel-perfect clarity.

With 144 Hz, 10-bit Color, 97% DCI-P3, HDR1000, and of course 4K, it's got some impressive specs. This monitor's hefty but seriously futuristic design runs throughout the whole setup. It would be a great choice if you want a statement piece for your form and want 120fps on PS5 or Xbox Series X.
