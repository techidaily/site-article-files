Go to the official website for Wondershare Filmora and download the latest version of the video editor on your computer. Run the software after the complete installation, and then follow the instructions below to delete background noise and silent parts from your ASMR videos:

Step1When Fiilmora opens, click on the **New Project** icon.

Scroll down to where you have the **Denoise** option, and check the **Remove background noise** option. Click on **OK**, and Filmora will immediately delete the background noise from the audio. Now you can export the video to your local drive. To do that click on the **Export** icon.

## FAQs

#### Q1\. What's the best polar pattern for ASMR microphones?

Having an ASMR microphone with multiple polar patterns is great but if you have the one with just a cardioid polar pattern that's cool. With a cardioid polar pattern mic, you can capture your voice without any background noise. We listed some microphones with only cardioid polar patterns in the article above. Check them out.

#### Q2\. How to choose the best ASMR Microphone?

Selecting the best ASMR microphone isn't easy, but here are some important factors to look out for to make the best decision:

* Affordability
* Polar Pattern
* Sensitivity
* Power source
* Condenser/Dynamic (Condenser is a better option)
