## Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?

![magic call voice changer app on app store](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg)

So, does [Magic Call](http://www.magiccall.co/) work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you'll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.

Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn't run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the "Continue" button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn't send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.

In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn't send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you'll have to purchase call credits. Overall, it's a decent app, although better alternatives exist.

## Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call
