How many high quality pictures and videos do social media and other online platforms handle daily? Here are the numbers for your reference. Internet users [share over 3.2 billion images and](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/amazing-social-media-statistics-and-facts/) over 720,000 hours of video daily. As such, you will discover different quality photos available everywhere.

However, there are several verified sites where you can find a high quality version of pictures for free. Below are the three top methods you should consider:

### 1\. Google Image Search

![google image search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/high-quality-pictures-1.jpg)

Google is by far the largest information source on the internet. As such, it should also be your number one source for high quality pictures. In addition, the search engine offers a separate service known as Google Image search, which allows you to get pictures across any subject.

However, you need to employ several filters when looking for high resolution images for websites. For example, you need to filter results by resolution and usage rights. This is because some photographers offer their work on the internet for commercial purposes, and using it without authorization can get you in serious trouble.

Below is how to get high quality versions of pictures for free using Google Image search:

* Open your browser and proceed to **Google Search**.
* Once there, click on Images at the top right corner to launch the **Google Image** search.
* Type your search query in the text box, and press **Enter** to receive your search results.
* Then, click on **Tools** to open additional filters, and select **Creative Commons licenses** under the **Usage Rights** option. Images under the creative commons license are free to use for personal and commercial licenses, depending on the hosting site.

Sometimes, users may remove the metadata of an image, making it difficult to know if an image is genuinely free to use. Therefore, always double-check its legality using reverse image search tools such as PicSearch and TinEye Reverse Image Search.

### 2\. Stock media sites image search (Unsplash supports the feature)

Alternatively, you can source high resolution background images for websites from stock media sites like Pexels and Unsplash. However, before downloading photos from them, you need to familiarize yourself with the following terms:

* **Creative Commons**

This nonprofit organization enables sharing your creativity and expertise with others through free channels. It provided different creative commons licenses, each with different rules of use of the content. For example, you can only use Unsplash-licensed content for free after making artistic alterations. As such, the image is completely different from the creator's, making it your own.

* **Royalty-free high-resolution pictures**

Although they contain the word free in their name, images with this title are necessarily so. This is because some sites require you to pay a one-time access fee to their library. In addition, websites for high quality images like Unsplash dedicate an entire category that features only royalty-free photos.

* **Public Domain**

Public domain content is creative assets whose copyrights are under these classifications: expired, forfeited, or inapplicable. However, you should remember that not all internet items are public domain content.

### 3\. Post the photo in relevant communities

### 2\. Use Photoshop to upscale your photos

![use photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/high-quality-pictures-5.jpg)

Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom are great alternatives for your image-enhancing needs. Both programs use AI resampling technology to increase your image quality and resolution. In addition, you get a free 7-day trial to test the software before purchasing one of its many subscription models.

Here is how to improve your image quality using Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.

* Right-click on the image file and select **Lightroom** as the run program.
* Click on the photo to launch the menu, and click on **Enhance**.
* Choose **Super Resolution** as the output, and click **Enhance** to complete the process. The program automatically selects the best pixels to enhance, doubling your image size and quadrupling the pixel count.

Alternatively, you can use the following steps when using Adobe Photoshop. Kindly note the software can enhance your image in the following ways.

**Adjust pixel dimensions**

* Launch Photoshop and select your image from the program library.
* Select Image Size from the photo menu to launch the adjustment menu.
* Enter the new image width and height values in the Dimensions section. Ensure you activate the chain icon to maintain your current width-to-height ratio.
* Select Resample and click OK to complete the image adjustment.

**Change Print Dimensions**

* Select the image you want to enhance from your Photoshop library.
* Under the Image option, click on Image Size and deselect the Resample option. This ensures your image maintains its current width and height ratios.
* You can change your image resolution by entering the new values into the Resolution and Document sections, then click Ok to finalize.

Adobe Photoshop also allows you to adjust the image interpolation method when enhancing your high resolution background images for websites. Currently, Photoshop offers these image interpolation options:

* The **Automatic** option lets Photoshop determine the best resampling values based on the image type.
* **Bicubic Smoother** allows you to achieve smoother results after your image enhancement. In addition, the **Bicubic Image Interpolation** options address your image's tonal gradations.
* The **Preserve Details** option uses an advanced upscaling algorithm that allows you to apply Noise Reduction to your images.
* **Nearest Neighbor** is best for your Illustrations since it allows you to adjust the image's hard edges and ensure no anti-aliasing.
* Alternatively, you can increase your image's pixel count by choosing the **Bilinear** Image Interpolation method. Photoshop averages the color values of surrounding pixels and uses the values to increase the pixel count.

Finally, applying the Unsharp Mask filter is the secret to achieving even better image quality with Photoshop.
