## Mastering the Art of Profile Age Precision on TikTok

TikTok is currently among the most popular apps in the world. It is a video-sharing platform where people share videos doing different activities. Due to the rise of cyberbullying, racism, and other harmful activities, concerns have been raised for minors using TikTok. In a bid to counter it, TikTok has banned kids under 13 from using the app.

The accounts of teens from 13 to 16 have been made private to minimize the negative effects. If you, by mistake, have entered the wrong birthdate when setting up your account, you can learn **how to change your age on TikTok** from this article.

## Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok

The 13-year age restriction on TikTok is not only to protect minors from the harmful side of the internet. It is to comply with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. To ensure that users don't cheat with age-requirement, TikTok has removed the option to edit the birthdate from the app.

It has also made all the accounts of those under 16 privates. If your account has been age-restricted by mistake, below are two possible methods on **how** **to edit age on TikTok**.

### Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)

Since TikTok has removed the feature to edit your birthdate from its app, you will need to contact their support team to change your age. You can contact support through the app if your account is still working. Otherwise, you will need to contact them through email. Below are the steps to contact support for changing your age through the TikTok app on your smartphone:

**Step 1:** Open your TikTok app and tap on "Profile" from the bottom right corner. Next, touch on "Three Lines" from the top right corner of the profile screen and access "Settings and Privacy."

![select settings and privacy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now navigate to the "Support & About" section and tap “Report a Problem.” Press "Account and Profile" on the next screen and tap "Editing Profile."

![select report a problem option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** Here, choose "Other," and on the next window, press “Need More Help?” It will open a feedback form where you can mention your problem and request the support team to solve it.

![tap on need more help](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-4.jpg)

### Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)

If your TikTok account has been placed under age restriction, you can create a new TikTok account with the correct age. However, it is not the recommended method, as you will lose all of your old account data and followers.

If you are underage, you should not try to create a new account with a false age. Lying about your age can result in legal difficulties for you if caught. You can create a new TikTok account on your smartphone using TikTok app through these steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install the TikTok app through Google Play Store or App Store and open it. Agree to their terms and services and tap “Profile” from the bottom right corner to navigate to the signup page.

![access the profile tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** If you choose “Email or Phone,” you will need to provide your “Email” or “Phone” on the next screen. You will need to go through a verification CAPTCHA and, on the next screen, create a password for your account. Provide your correct birthdate and press "Next" to complete the account creation.
