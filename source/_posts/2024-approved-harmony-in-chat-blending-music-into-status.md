## Part 4 Rules Of WhatsApp Status You Should Know

By using the WhatsApp status feature, you will get an opportunity to share different types of media files, such as – video, image, GIF, and text as well. The main factor about this status feature is that it will be visible for 24 hours only. Even it is a public sharing method but the WhatsApp still keeps the complete procedure protected with end-to-end encryption.

If you want to receive or send updates regarding WhatsApp status, both ends should have each other’s contact saved in the contact book of the phone.

### How To Create And Send A Status Update?

##### Step1 Firstly, you should access the WhatsApp application and open the STATUS tab
