### 7\. Widgets and Chat Customization

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.

However, some people do not like using this kind of stuff. They don’t even prefer crowding their taskbar. For such cases, you can turn them off from the toggle switches that are available in the ‘Show or Hide the buttons that appear on Taskbar' or 'Taskbar Items. '
