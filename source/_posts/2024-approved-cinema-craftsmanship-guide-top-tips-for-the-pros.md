## Cinema Craftsmanship Guide: Top Tips for the Pros

Do you want to experience top-tier cinematic effects but are low on budget? Unfortunately, professional high-quality cinematic effects require expensive gadgets that cost a lot of money. Of course, everyone wants to create the best cinematic shots, but spending a lot of money for TikTok or Facebook views is not a good idea.

You can use common household items to uplift the quality of your videos. But how to use these tricks to get great cinematic shots? Don't worry; this article will guide you about using top cinematic/camera tips to boost your video-making experience. We are starting with the smooth camera movement.

## Tip 1\. Smooth Camera Movement

Still, if you are on a budget, you can use some everyday household objects to get a smooth camera shot. Follow the steps below to get a smooth cinematic video using your phone and duct tape only.

**Steps**

Step 1 Attach your phone to the side of a door using duct tape or any strong tape that can hold your phone and not let it fall.

### DIY LED Panel

You can create LED Panel at home to add light to a subject. Unfortunately, LED strips do not produce bright light when spread as a straight line. However, we can use cardboard and LED light strips to build a broader, more brilliant light. Follow the steps below to make DIY LED Panel.

**Steps**

Step 1 Take a cardboard and an LED strip.

Step 2 Using glue or tape, stick the LED light strip on the cardboard in a spiral shape.

Step 3 Make sure the gap between each spiral is uniform.

Step 4 Plug in the LED strip and use this LED Panel for a broader light source.

Alright! Let's check out how it looks in the video below.
