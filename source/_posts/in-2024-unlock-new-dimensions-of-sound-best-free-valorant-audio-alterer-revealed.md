## Part3: Best Voice editor - Filmora

![best video editor for everyone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/filmora-video-editor.jpg)

Do you want to go into video editing as a content or social media marketer in order to stay up with the expanding video trend? Don't worry! For a newbie, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) might be a good option.

Consider your spending capacity, the present level of knowledge, and the amount of time you're prepared to invest in learning a new skill. Don't hesitate to decide whether you're searching for the top YouTube video editing software or have been given the task of getting your team's video marketing plan up to par. Invest in one of these video editing products.

Most video editing programs offer 4K and GIFs as standard capabilities, but Filmora excels at titles. While Filmora's title tools aren't as powerful as an Apple Final Cut Pro X, which can superimpose 3D titles over your films and rotate them on three axes, they still offer some nifty titling capabilities for the price you're paying.

Another appealing feature of Filmora for novices to video editing is "Easy Mode," which enables you to make sophisticated, enjoyable edits by dragging and dropping clips, picking a theme, and choosing music.

Features include the title tool, screen, mobile editing, and "Easy Mode."

Pricing: A perpetual license begins at $79.99.
