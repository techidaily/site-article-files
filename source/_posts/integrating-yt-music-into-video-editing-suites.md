Let’s start discussing how to add YouTube music to video by using Filmora. Step-By-Step process:

**Step 1:** Import Files

First of all, you need to add files to the Filmora that you want to edit. You should proceed by importing the video first. In case you want to get audio or music for background from other sources than a built-in library of Filmora, you should import the audio file as well. It will allow you to add media files to the Filmora library and provide easy access for quick edits. For all these things, you can see the IMPORT option in the menu.

**Step 2:** Separate Audio Tracks

In some cases, you may find an existing audio or music track in the video. This particular track may spoil the complete video and create multiple problems. Here, it will be a nice decision to separate the video from the existing audio. It can be possible by using the DETACH AUDIO TRACK features. After detaching the audio, you can also edit that particular one, such as – modifying, altering, or removing. For saving time and avoid multiple menu interactions, you can proceed by using the shortcut command. It is – Ctrl+Alt+D.

**Step 3:** Audio Keyframing

If you don’t find the audio or sound effect properly suitable for your video, you should proceed with editing features. You will get a complete audio editor with multiple functionalities and features. Here, you can perform complete audio keyframing activities that will allow you to get a smooth and desired audio file for increasing the video’s effectiveness.
