## Exploring Best 4K Video Converter Apps for MP3 Output

Though YouTube allows uploading 4K videos, the files being high in quality and large in size takes a lot of time in getting uploaded. Moreover, while uploading a 4K video, you need to adhere to the file parameters like frame rate, bit rate, and container as recommended by YouTube.

In order to overcome all these issues and others related to 4K uploading, the best solution is to downscale the video to the highest quality.
