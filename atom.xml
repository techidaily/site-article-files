With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352557/5172" target="_top" id="352557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352557/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media. Then, you can join them on their favorite platforms and connect with them there.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premium-uav-selection-in-stock/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Premium UAV Selection in Stock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tap-into-the-funny-kapwing-for-meme-makers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Tap Into the Funny Kapwing for Meme Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-dive-into-screen-recording-expert-insights-on-top-obs-software/"><u>[New] Dive Into Screen Recording Expert Insights on Top OBS Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-igtv-deactivation-methods-for-2024/"><u>[New] IGTV Deactivation Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-observers-lens-reportage/"><u>[New] In 2024, Observer's Lens Reportage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sj7-4k-star-camera-an-in-depth-look-at-the-latest-action-tech/"><u>[New] In 2024, SJ7 4K Star Camera An In-Depth Look at the Latest Action Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-standout-literary-book-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Standout Literary Book Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-best-batch-eight-websites-where-text-meets-gleaming-3d-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best Batch Eight Websites Where Text Meets Gleaming 3D for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-the-potential-of-ios-albums-ordering-and-cloud-syncing-essentials/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking the Potential of iOS Albums Ordering & Cloud Syncing Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-tips-for-staying-positive-in-the-face-of-critical-youtube-comments/"><u>[Updated] Tips for Staying Positive in the Face of Critical YouTube Comments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-10-budget-friendly-platforms-for-youtube-branding-mastery/"><u>2024 Approved 10 Budget-Friendly Platforms for YouTube Branding Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleash-superior-hd-videos-on-android-devices/"><u>2024 Approved Unleash Superior HD Videos on Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/7-top-ways-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-for-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>7 Top Ways To Resolve Apple ID Not Active Issue For iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/authentication-error-occurred-on-lava-storm-5g-here-are-10-proven-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Authentication Error Occurred on Lava Storm 5G?

Smartphones are incredibly versatile and</p><p>widely used. Where does that leave the desktop PC, a relic of the 1980s? There are still a ton of options</p><p>available, and the desktop market is constantly innovating, particularly regarding all-in-one and small-</p><p>form-factor devices. But many customers appear to view desktop computers as an antique, since they</p><p>immediately walk to the laptop aisle when making their next computer purchase.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Corsair One i300</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Lenovo Yoga A940</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Azulle Access4</a></li><li><a href="#part2-6">Alienware Aurora R13</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much CPU power do you need</a></li><li><a href="#part4">What graphics card do you need</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What desktops are recommended?"></a>Part 2. What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5" class="headerlink" title="1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5"></a>1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</h3><p>Even so, there are times when you just want the best of the best, the absolute cream of the crop. It won’t be</p><p>for everyone, of course.

How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012420/19272" target="_top" id="2012420">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012420" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012420/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal. If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills. The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082521/7443" target="_top" id="2082521">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082521" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082521/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Alienware Aurora R13"></a>6. Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal. If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills. The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-efficient-techniques-for-adobe-presenter-capture/"><u>[Updated] Efficient Techniques for Adobe Presenter Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-story-keepers-at-the-click-no-limits-allowed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Story Keepers at the Click, No Limits Allowed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-transform-your-pubg-presence-with-new-sounds/"><u>[Updated] Transform Your PUBG Presence with New Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-11-step-by-step-pathways-to-perfect-grading/"><u>2024 Approved 11 Step by Step Pathways to Perfect Grading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-game-on-in-reality-discover-the-top-5-samsung-vr-titles/"><u>2024 Approved Game On in Reality!

It was very clear from the developers that they are still launching games keeping the PC and Smart Phones in mind. These are still the most popular platforms where 49 percent of the developers made their latest release on PC&#x2F;Mac, around 41 percent chose smart phones and tablets to be the best medium.</p><p> It is quite clear from the discussion that the game developers prefer PC&#x2F;Laptops&#x2F;Mac over any other devices to release their games. But, this year’s survey came up with a different result where 59.7 percent developers preferably chose PC&#x2F;Mac followed by 48.3 percent developers who chose virtual reality headsets for their upcoming games. So, we can say that despite the indomitable popularity of the PC and Mac, virtual reality is also gaining a strong ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-VR-gaming-development-is-truly-rising-then"><a href="#The-VR-gaming-development-is-truly-rising-then" class="headerlink" title="The VR gaming development is truly rising then"></a>The VR gaming development is truly rising then</h2><p> Is it really the right time to make comment like virtual reality is really uprising as a gaming platform? If you take the year of year survey report, yes the result shows a significant uptick for the interest of this platform. If we look back at the last year’s survey, it revealed that only 33.4 percent of the developers were interested to develop games for VR platforms. If you consider in terms of interest, VR was placed behind the PC&#x2F;Mac, PlayStation 4, smartphones or tablets. But, considering this year’s data, we can see more advancement in the interest for the VR platform! More and more European developers are now getting interested to develop games for VR platforms that the smartphones or tablets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-gaming1.jpg"                      alt="vr-gaming "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052059/7443" target="_top" id="2052059">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052059" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052059/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This clears the air that VR is turning to be an emerging platform for the European game developers but, which one is preferred more by the professional game developers – is it the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive or something else for that matter? The survey also includes a detailed report on that as well. Asking about which VR platform they are using – 23.1 percent developers said they are using Rift, Vive is slightly behind with 22 percent developers’ preferences. There is PlayStation VR headset as well with 11.8 percent preferences.</p><p> However, despite having such acceptance by the professional game developers, the confidence for the VR games market seems to have dropped a bit – at least the recent survey is showing something like that. Last year, 71.7 percent of the game developers considered VR to be a sustainable long-term market while in this year, it slipped a little with 68.8 percent developers are thinking VR could be a long sustaining gaming market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="About-the-European-VR-game-makers-and-their-funding"><a href="#About-the-European-VR-game-makers-and-their-funding" class="headerlink" title="About the European VR game makers and their funding"></a>About the European VR game makers and their funding</h2><p> Funding for the games has always remained one of the prime concerns for the game developers and publishers. You know that it takes large amounts to be invested for the games. When it comes to the funding policies for the European game developers, most of them are covering the entire expenses using their own funds. Take a look at what the survey report has to say about that. Asking about the sources of the fund for the games 57.8 percent said that their funds come from the company’s existing fund while contrary to this, 32.9 percent game developers said that they manage their own fund from their personal accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-developer.jpg"                      alt=" vr-developer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We know that crowdsourced funding is also a preferable way to manage funds but, this seems not very convenient for the VR game developers since a very poor percentage (5.2) of the developers replied that they are working on games the fund of which is crowdsourced. While some developers consider this as an awful idea, some mentioned this to be a tricky process.</p><p> Overall, this is what cooking inside the VR gaming world and this survey report explains the different aspects of virtual reality that clearly presents the state of the VR industry on this year – 2016.

You may use a meme generator to generate the meme by opening it, choosing a template of a solid color, and then adding text. If you write in your text, it will become a meme that only exists in text.

You can upload custom templates by selecting the “upload new template” option when you want to submit a picture from a personal device. A basic picture may serve as the template, and text boxes can subsequently be added to the image to make it a meme.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-What-is-the-best-meme-generator-1"><a href="#3-What-is-the-best-meme-generator-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

The IMGFlip has many great features and is compatible with a variety of operating systems, but compared to Filmora, its monthly membership rate of up to $9.95 is just too exorbitant. Also, Filmora Meme Generator is free despite the fact that IMGFlip provides amazing enhancements like as improved video frame rate, no-watermark, and greater processing speed upon membership. Because of a number of its user-friendly features, this program provides straightforward communication with the audience.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Online resources are widely accessible for creating memes. The fact that IMGFlip is a well-known tool that can handle media files and is simple to use is also evident from this article. Even though it costs money, IMGFlip is a really helpful tool. The services offered by IMGFlip are quite good. But since it provides a wide variety of features and skills for free, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is far better.

The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1. Top Windows 10 Features"></a>1. Top Windows 10 Features</h4><p>With Windows 10, it would seem as though Microsoft actually listened to people. The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2. More Windows 10 Features</h4><p>The above three features are good examples of what Windows 10 will bring to the table, but that’s not it by a long shot:</p><p><strong>Xbox App and Streaming</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/xboy-games-windows10-1.png"                      alt="xbox games windows10"                ></p><p>Windows 10 will include an exciting Xbox app, which will come loaded with possibilities. The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games. Even more exciting is the way you’ll have the ability to play multiplayer titles across between your Xbox One and your PC. With the streaming side of things, Windows 10 will allow you to stream titles from your Xbox Box. There will also be DirectX 12 support.</p><p> <strong>Universal Apps</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/universal_apps.jpg"                      alt="universal_apps"                ></p><p>If you’re going to use Windows 10 across several different devices, you’re going to love this aspect. Photos, Music, Video, Map, People, and other apps will be available across all your devices. Furthermore, Windows 10 will ensure that your apps will look and function the same, regardless of the app you’re using.</p><p> <strong>Design and Interface Improvements</strong></p><p>There is a cohesiveness and consistency to everything that is going to make Windows 10 a highly pleasant experience for most of the people who use it.

So, just ensure 2 things.</p><h4 id="Go-to-Set-Resolution"><a href="#Go-to-Set-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Go to Set Resolution"></a>Go to Set Resolution</h4><p> One thing you must remember is that when the resolution is set high, only then can your photos be of the best quality. While clicking a picture, always try to focus your subject than zooming in. The cropped photos are much better and high resolution than the zoomed in images. The only problem you can face with high resolution photos is storing. So, try to store the images in the photo sharing apps or in the cloud storage like Dropbox or Picasa.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-resolution.JPG"                      alt="set resolution"                ></p><h4 id="Cleaning-the-Lens-is-Important"><a href="#Cleaning-the-Lens-is-Important" class="headerlink" title="Cleaning the Lens is Important"></a>Cleaning the Lens is Important</h4><p> In Android photography second important thing to keep in mind is cleaning the lens of the device. Your mobile phone spends a lot of time in your pocket or in your hands. Your fingerprints and dust can conceal the lens of your Android phone obstructing a clear image while clicking. A grime filled lens tend to block the entry of light, resulting in cloudy and vague images. Use a cleaning solution and a microfiber cloth to clean the lens of your device for a crystal clear image using your Android phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clean-lens-android.jpg"                      alt="clean lens"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Tips-for-Amazing-Android-Photography"><a href="#6-Tips-for-Amazing-Android-Photography" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips for Amazing Android Photography"></a>6 Tips for Amazing Android Photography</h2><h4 id="Make-Use-of-Selfie-Stick"><a href="#Make-Use-of-Selfie-Stick" class="headerlink" title="Make Use of Selfie-Stick"></a>Make Use of Selfie-Stick</h4><p> Have you ever faced stability problem while clicking a photo? Have you been frustrated for a blurred snap due to camera stability issues? A selfie stick or the monopod is a solution to all your problems. It is long enough to take a shot from a distance during the Android Photography, and most importantly it is best for the selfies. The tripods, on the other hand, are for slow-shutter speed. These are portable and you can use your Android phone from any angle to take the photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/selfie-stick-iphone.jpg"                      alt="selfie stick"                ></p><h4 id="It-is-Always-Light"><a href="#It-is-Always-Light" class="headerlink" title="It is Always Light"></a>It is Always Light</h4><p> While Android photography, it is important that your subject faces the light. Many Android phone cameras do not have the flash option. In such a case, if the subject is at the back of the light and you are facing light then the subject will appear dark. Unless a silhouette shot, you need not face the light, let your subject face it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-equipment04.JPG"                      alt="light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="The-Rule-of-Thirds"><a href="#The-Rule-of-Thirds" class="headerlink" title="The Rule of Thirds"></a>The Rule of Thirds</h4><p> What is the rule of thirds? It is a compositional gridline to guide the inexperienced in photography and painting. It helps in taking photos by creating grids and dividing the photo into nine equal parts. The photos are better and interesting when the subjects astride the imaginary lines dividing the photograph into 2 vertical and 2 horizontal guide lines. For a more balanced image, ensure that the subject is slightly of the centre.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rule-of-third.jpg"                      alt="rule of third"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Change-Your-Focus"><a href="#Change-Your-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Change Your Focus"></a>Change Your Focus</h4><p> What is your subject? While clicking photos, your camera cannot track your subject by Auto focussing option. So to ensure a flawless photo, it is essential that you touch your finger on the screen to focus manually. You just need to touch right on your subject to set your focus completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-android.JPG"                      alt="focus android"                ></p><h4 id="Do-Not-Zoom-In-Out"><a href="#Do-Not-Zoom-In-Out" class="headerlink" title="Do Not Zoom In&#x2F;Out"></a>Do Not Zoom In&#x2F;Out</h4><p> As already mentioned earlier, in Android photography the digital zoom feature is not really worth it. Cropping a photo is far better an option than zooming in. Try to step closer to your subject, if you want to get a clear picture of it. If your cannot, then focus on your subject and click to crop it later. The digital zooming feature cannot be the solution to a clear picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-in-android.JPG"                      alt="zoom in out android"                ></p><h4 id="Use-HDR-Effect"><a href="#Use-HDR-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Use HDR Effect"></a>Use HDR Effect</h4><p> The default camera apps include the HDR feature in the iOS and Android devices. The HDR or the high definition range is a filter that can be used as and when required. Get the HDR toggle on both the OSes, just on the shutter screen itself. The HDR in the Android photography keeps the balance between the dark and the light parts of your image. Keep the phone steady as it requires a long exposure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hdr-android.JPG"                      alt="hdr"                ></p><h2 id="Best-Free-Third-Party-Editing-Apps"><a href="#Best-Free-Third-Party-Editing-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Third-Party Editing Apps"></a>Best Free Third-Party Editing Apps</h2><p> The above-mentioned tips are definitely quite useful but there are certain times when these tips are not enough to make your photos perfect. When the Android photography lacks the special effect to make the images perfect, the only savior in such situations is the free third-party apps for editing. Let’s check out some of the free apps to make your Android photography completely amazing.</p><h4 id="1-PhotoShop-Express"><a href="#1-PhotoShop-Express" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s really free to utilize one of the most well-liked ones. You want to make your voice better for your next audio production, right? You most likely searched the internet and came across some cool audio program named Audacity. Mix tracks or add effects to your recordings to edit your audio utilizing the cut, copy, and paste tools with limitless undo capability.</p><p>For audio analysis applications, Audacity additionally has an integrated amplitude-envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode, and a frequency-analysis window. The ideal way to get started in the realm of audio editing is using Audacity. It was created by volunteers using open-source software. With Audacity, you can do a lot of things, such trim files to make them shorter, take away background noise, cut out silence, change volume, and more. The drop-down menu located underneath the sound level meters on top allows you to rapidly choose between the numerous audio sources.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Crossfade?"></a>Part 1. What is Crossfade?</h2><p>Crossfading process allows two sounds to segue smoothly into one another. Crossfading is an audio effect that is often used in audio engineering to merge two or more sounds in a song gradually rather than suddenly. This method is mostly used to prevent any abrupt silences between two songs, which might disturb listeners. As a result of the development of the computer-based digital audio editor, crossfading became more straightforward.</p><p>When you cross fade music, you cause one piece of audio to fade out—the sound gradually vanishes—at the precise same moment as another piece of audio fades in—the sound gradually manifests. This effect produces a seamless transition between the two songs without any abrupt pauses or quiet in between. The volume of audio in the source files is the sole restriction on the duration of the fade in a digital editor that supports crossfading between two or more files.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity"></a>Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity</h2><p>Don’t be intimidated by the capabilities of this audio program. Before the first event completely vanishes into the second, the crossfade gradually transitions by overlaying the events at the transition point so that both are seen or heard at the same time. Using Audacity, it’s easy to reduce some of the background noise in your audio track. You must create a noise profile to do this. We’ve put up a helpful guide on how to use Audacity to enhance your audio productions.</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Audacity Crossfade</strong>:</p><p>Step1 Select File, Import, and Audio from the menu.

Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279.

The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1. Top Windows 10 Features"></a>1. Top Windows 10 Features</h4><p>With Windows 10, it would seem as though Microsoft actually listened to people. The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2. More Windows 10 Features</h4><p>The above three features are good examples of what Windows 10 will bring to the table, but that’s not it by a long shot:</p><p><strong>Xbox App and Streaming</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/xboy-games-windows10-1.png"                      alt="xbox games windows10"                ></p><p>Windows 10 will include an exciting Xbox app, which will come loaded with possibilities. The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games. Even more exciting is the way you’ll have the ability to play multiplayer titles across between your Xbox One and your PC. With the streaming side of things, Windows 10 will allow you to stream titles from your Xbox Box. There will also be DirectX 12 support.</p><p> <strong>Universal Apps</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/universal_apps.jpg"                      alt="universal_apps"                ></p><p>If you’re going to use Windows 10 across several different devices, you’re going to love this aspect. Photos, Music, Video, Map, People, and other apps will be available across all your devices. Furthermore, Windows 10 will ensure that your apps will look and function the same, regardless of the app you’re using.</p><p> <strong>Design and Interface Improvements</strong></p><p>There is a cohesiveness and consistency to everything that is going to make Windows 10 a highly pleasant experience for most of the people who use it. You’ll find that in terms of design and user interface, Windows 10 is a combination of modern features, the few good things about Windows 8 and Windows 8.1., and elements from past editions that we never wanted to get rid of.</p><h4 id="3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10"><a href="#3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="3.Get Ready For Windows 10"></a>3.Get Ready For Windows 10</h4><p>Some people are already enjoying Windows 10. Microsoft is slowly-but-surely making sure that everyone gets Windows 10 in good time.

Time-lapse videos are ideal for quickly showing how things develop over a period and are often created when buildings are being constructed, projects are being worked or to show how a scene changes over the course of a day. There are many different apps that you can download to your iPhone to obtain exceptional time-lapse video footage, with effects including Loop, Bounce and Long Exposure.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: How to record time-lapse video</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: What you need to know before you begin</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Recommended third-party app</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-How-to-record-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Part1-How-to-record-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to record time-lapse video"></a>Part1: How to record time-lapse video</h2><p>If you wish to record time-lapse video on your iPhone, you will need the most recent version of iOS. For best results and a higher-resolution, use a modern iPhone as these can even offer 4K video at a maximum of 30 frames-per-second. Here are the steps you need to take to get started.</p><ul><li>Open the iPhone Camera app, swiping right or down to get to the Time-Lapse section.</li><li>Tap the Record button to begin recording your video</li><li>Tap again to stop and save the video.</li><li>To find your video, head to the Photos app’s Recently Added, Camera Roll or Video sections.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/time-lapse-iphone.jpg"                      alt="time lapse"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-What-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin"><a href="#Part2-What-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What you need to know before you begin"></a>Part2: What you need to know before you begin</h2><p><strong>Shorter time -</strong> It’s usually best to shoot for a long period of time to get the best results. The footage you obtain will be much shorter than the length of time you are shooting for, which means you will need to remain patient to get the best results. You can usually get around 40 seconds of time-lapse footage from a 10-minute session, which means you would need to shoot for around an hour to make a four-minute clip. The reason for this is that the footage is played at a specific number of frames per second, which is substantially more frames than the app you will be using can capture. The number of frames taken per second will depend not only on the app you are using but the settings you choose too.</p><p><strong>Be stable -</strong> Your iPhone also needs to remain as stable as possible so you can prevent camera from motioning and jittering and avoid compromising the quality of the results. If you are able to use a tripod or stand rather than holding your device in your hand, this will be very helpful. Don’t forget to lock the focus, exposure or both before you start recording. You also need to ensure that your iPhone has enough storage space to capture and hold your video. Time-lapse videos can be data-heavy due to the way the feature uses a large buffer and video cache. This is especially important if you are shooting in hi-resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080347/19272" target="_top" id="2080347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080347/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part3-Recommended-third-party-app"><a href="#Part3-Recommended-third-party-app" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Recommended third-party app"></a>Part3: Recommended third-party app</h2><p>Though you may find the time-lapse functionality on the iPhone camera satisfactory, you can get much better results by downloading a third-party app. Here are two of the most popular iPhone apps on the market for capturing time-lapse footage.</p><h4 id="1-Lapse-It"><a href="#1-Lapse-It" class="headerlink" title="1.
