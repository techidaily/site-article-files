    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Leading-Camera-Innovations-Revealed-Future-Edition"><a href="#Leading-Camera-Innovations-Revealed-Future-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Leading Camera Innovations Revealed - Future Edition"></a>Leading Camera Innovations Revealed - Future Edition</h2><p>When you ask an expert or a professional about which is the best camera of 2024, you’ll probably will receive a different answer from both. Depending on what you want to use it for, the best camera for recording YouTube videos won’t be the same as a camera you would pick for live streaming on Twitch, a holiday or for starting as an influencer. In this article we’ve collected a wide range of camera models at different price points, including, action cameras, smartphones, DSLR’s, mirrorless cameras and purpose-made cameras. All of the included cameras film video in completely different ways and some models are better alternatives than others.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right in!</p><h2 id="1-Fujifilm-X-S10"><a href="#1-Fujifilm-X-S10" class="headerlink" title="1. Fujifilm X-S10"></a>1. Fujifilm X-S10</h2><p>The Fujifilm’s X-S10 has a 26-megapixel interchangeable lens that shoots high-quality 4K video and has a deep grip and a different, though splendid, control scheme than other Fujifilm cameras. Fujifilm describes the X-S10 as a mix between the Fujifilm’s X-T30 and the X-H1 series. You get the strength from the previous model and the design and in-body photo stabilization. This X-S10 camera is suitable for both beginners and experienced users that use Nikon or Canon DSLR’s and want something a little more similar than a regular Fujifilm camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fujifilm-x-s10.jpg"                      alt="fujifilm x s10"                ></p><p>Fujifilm did not disclose what the S is standing for in the name of the X-S10, we think it might stand for ‘small’ or ‘slim’, or maybe ‘simple’. Let’s take a look at the details: the X-S10 measures 126 x 85x 65 mm and weighs 465 grams. For the dimensions, it lays between the X-T30 and the X-T4.</p><p><strong>Fujifilm X-S10 specifications</strong></p><ul><li>Single UHS-I card slot</li><li>5-axis in-body image stabilization</li><li>Wi-Fi + Bluetooth</li><li>On-sensor phase detection</li><li>325 shots per charge using LCD</li><li>26MP X-Trans BSI-CMOS sensor</li><li>3”, 1.04M-dot fully articulating touchscreen</li><li>30 fps burst shooting with crop (up to 20 fps without)</li><li>USB Power Delivery support</li><li>36M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</li><li>DCI and UHD 4K capture at up to 30p with F-Log support</li><li>External mic and headphone sockets</li></ul><h2 id="2-Canon-EOS-R5"><a href="#2-Canon-EOS-R5" class="headerlink" title="2. Canon EOS R5"></a>2. Canon EOS R5</h2><p>In our opinion, the Canon EOS R5 is by far Canon’s most precious product. It’s the perfect combination of the EOS R’s form, the EOS 5D’s function, together with the professional autofocus of the EOS-1D X. If you’re a hybrid or a stills shooter who shifts between videography and photography. It’s one of the most robust cameras you will ever own. It has achieved a lot of wrong attention, probably for overheating (or the possibility of it) when recording your videos in 8K resolution. But this should not decrease the quality of this camera’s incredible potential.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/canon-eos-r5.jpg"                      alt="canon eos r5"                ></p><p>With its frame rate and its video capabilities combined together, this is honestly a monumental camera. It’s taken the spot of the more expensive Sony A1 just to see how good this EOS R5 from Canon is. The Canon EOS R5 is incredible at photographing wildlife, it’s more or less a way around for capturing images of animals and people, or other objects from far away or close-up shots.</p><p>For the professional photographer who needs speed, video capabilities and resolution, there is the Canon EOS R5. Setting a new boundary for versatility, the full-frame mirrorless camera contains a perfectly designed 45-megapixel CMOS sensor, which offers 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, 8K raw video recording. It’s the first EOS camera to contain a 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilizer.</p><p><strong>Canon EOS R5 specifications</strong></p><ul><li>ISO range: 100-51,200 (expandable to 50-102,400)</li><li>Image processor: Digic X</li><li>AF points: 5,940 Dual Pixel CMOS AF II</li><li>Sensor: 45MP full-frame CMOS 36 x 24mm</li><li>Max image size: 8,192 x 5,464px</li><li>Video: 8K DCI or UHD at 30p, 24p &#x2F; 4K DCI or UHD at 120p, 100p, 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p &#x2F; 1080p (FullHD) at 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p</li><li>Max burst: 12fps mechanical shutter, 20fps electronic shutter</li><li>Viewfinder: 0.5-inch OLED EVF, 5,690k dots, 100% coverage, 0.76x magnification, 120fps refresh rate</li><li>Memory card: 1x CFexpress type B, 1x UHS-II SD&#x2F;SDHC&#x2F;SDXC</li><li>Stabilization: 5-axis, up to 8 stops</li><li>Metering zones: 384</li><li>LCD: 3.15-inch fully articulating touchscreen, 2,100k dots.</li><li>Connectivity: Wi-Fi 5Ghz and 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2), micro HDMI (type D), microphone, headphone, N3 remote, flash sync, gigabit ethernet (via WFT-R10 grip)</li></ul><h2 id="3-Nikon-D3500"><a href="#3-Nikon-D3500" class="headerlink" title="3. Nikon D3500"></a>3. Nikon D3500</h2><p>The Nikon D3500 is one of the best DSLR cameras available for beginners that are looking to create stunning, manual photos using a regular setup. While it’s containing great image quality, easy-to-use menus and a superior battery life, this camera offers incredible value. Mirrorless competition should also be contemplated, especially when you want 4K resolution or a touch screen for easier use. After our review, this Nikon’s entry-level DSLR keeps the lead by giving the type of value and quality that mirrorless cameras do not succeed to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/nikon-d3500.jpg"                      alt="nikon d3500"                ></p><p>When you are searching for a smaller camera for recording traveling content, other mirrorless options like the Canon EOS M50 Mark II or Fujifilm X-T200 are great possibilities too. When it comes to an affordable camera for starters, the Nikon D3500 is the perfect solution. The D3500’s ISO sensitivity range of 100-25,600 is quite wide and doesn’t improve on the D3400’s range.</p><p>Nikon decided to keep the same 3-inch display, including the 921,000-dot resolution from the D3400 model. If you desire a DSLR with a vari-angle display, then you should explore the range to the Nikon D5600.</p><p>Seeing the rear screen is an optical viewfinder. This is perhaps the clearest feature that distinguishes DSLR’s from mirrorless cameras. Many mirrorless cameras barely show on the rear screen for shooting, while other models will include viewfinders with quite better resolutions.</p><p><strong>Nikon D3500 Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Camera type: DSLR</li><li>Sensor: 24.2MP APS-C CMOS 4, 23.5 x 15.6mm</li><li>Lens mount: Nikon F</li><li>In-body image stabilization (IBIS): No</li><li>Full frame: No</li><li>AF points: 11-point AF, 1 cross-type</li><li>Image processor: EXPEED 4</li><li>Memory card: SD&#x2F;SDHC&#x2F;SDXC UHS I</li><li>Max image size: 6,000 x 4,000px</li><li>ISO range: 100 to 25,600</li><li>Video: 1920 x 1080 at 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p</li><li>Metering zones: 420 pixel RGB sensor</li><li>Viewfinder: Optical pentamirror, 95% coverage</li><li>Max burst: 5fps</li><li>LCD: 3.0-inch fixed, 921K dots</li><li>Size: 124 x 97 x 69.5mm (body only)</li><li>Connectivity: Bluetooth</li><li>Weight: 415g (body only, with battery and memory card)</li></ul><h2 id="4-Olympus-OM-D-E-M10-Mark-IV"><a href="#4-Olympus-OM-D-E-M10-Mark-IV" class="headerlink" title="4. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV"></a>4. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV</h2><p>Introducing the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV! This is the entry-level camera in Olympus’s DSLR range of Micro Four Thirds models. This is definitely an upgrade from the beginner-range E-PL range, giving you more control, also improved quality and a wide range of features. This camera contains a 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor, flip-down touchscreen, an in-body image stabilizer, an easy-to-use interface and of course the 4K video option. The E-M10 IV is out now in two types of kits, a black or silver body including the compact 14-42mm F3.5-5.6 EZ lens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/olympus-omd-em10.jpg"                      alt="olympus omd em10"                ></p><p>The camera’s continuous autofocus has been redesigned using techniques from the E-M1X model. This reduces occurrences of the camera locking focus to the background and not focusing on your predetermined topic.</p><p>Olympus did also add a Live View Boost option that allows you to make both focusing and framing in darker environments a lot easier. The E-M10 III’s Live View Boost option hardly increases the viewfinder drive, but on the E-M10 IV it can also diminish the frame rate. This allows a substantially more luminant viewfinder frame.</p><p>The E-M10 IV is still employing a contrast-detect autofocus structure, For us it’s not a problem, even while shooting in 4K resolution. We noticed that the night display mode is way easier to use but implements only to the Remote Shutter screen. Its more red scheme supports in protecting your night vision while filming night skies, it does allows your external light source to be quickly changed with a vertical wipe onto the screen</p><p><strong>Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>5-axis in-body image stabilization (up to 4.5 stops)</li><li>20 Megapixel Live MOS sensor (Four Thirds)</li><li>121-point contrast-detect AF system</li><li>Wi-Fi + Bluetooth</li><li>Flip-down touchscreen display</li><li>TruePic VIII processor</li><li>USB charging</li><li>Electronic viewfinder</li><li>360 shots per charge (with LCD)</li><li>5 fps burst shooting w&#x2F;AF</li></ul><h2 id="5-DJI-Pocket-2"><a href="#5-DJI-Pocket-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DJI Pocket 2"></a>5. DJI Pocket 2</h2><p>The DJI Pocket 2 is a second-generation all-in-one camera that has an amazing built-in three-axis stabilizer. This camera stays about the same capacity as the regular, and contains a wider lens, bigger sensor, more microphones, an improved autofocus system, with the option to film higher-quality videos photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-pocket-2.jpg"                      alt="dji pocket 2"                ></p><p>The design of the Pocket 2 is almost the same to the original and it holds a Mini Control Stick that shove into the area previously kept free for a smartphone placement. When you are using the Mini Control Stick, the buttons to operate the Pocket will increase to five from two. We want to mention that there are a few changes with the button design, the operation is still natural just like the original.</p><p>The DJI Pocket comes standard with all accessories to use with your smartphone without the Do-It-All handle.</p><p>You need to tilt and zoom using the smartphone app, and that is not as spontaneous as the Mini Control Stick. The Do-It-All handle is perfect for using your smartphone like the screen. It’s crucial to download the Mimo application and the Do-It-All handle if you want to go stream.</p><p>The microphone quality on the Pocket is something to go for because of the extra microphones. It makes it super easy for recordings to sound way better than regular smartphones. The Pocket 2 has the option to shoot 3x3 panoramas. The 180º panorama captures four pictures and combines them into one long photo, while the 3x3 panorama mode captures 9 images and then puts them into a 5x7 image. We recommend a tripod with 3x3 panoramas to cancel out any camera shakes.</p><p><strong>DJI Pocket 2 Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>DJI Pocket 2 specifications:</li><li>20mm (equiv.)

GoPro Hero 10 Black"></a>6. GoPro Hero 10 Black</h2><p>When we think about action cameras designed for sports, GoPro is the first thing that comes to mind. According to our records, the GoPro Hero 10 Black is GoPro’s new leader for 2024. It resembles a similar layout and the same sensor introduced on the GoPro Hero 9 Black edition. This camera is packed with a new processor. While the screens on the GoPro’s are LCD’s, they are not as crisp as AMOLED panels. The GoPro Hero 10 Black’s interface is the same as what previous GoPro’s. Wipe your finger to browse through the menus to go back and forth between the modes. Swipe up to show the video files on the memory card and swipe down to enter the camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg"                      alt="gopro hero 10 black"                ></p><p>We can all agree that the GoPro Hero 9 Black is a solid camera, but its (sometimes) unresponsive LCD screen kind of broke people’s expectations. GoPro handles feedback really well and the camera also boasts quicker frame rates. The entire GoPro experience also saw a punch up in terms of experiences. The GoPro app now reinforces wired transfers and better live streaming support. This GoPro Hero 10 Black also showcases a new HyperSmooth 4.0 stabilization, which keeps video steadier.</p><p>We like to point out that it is a good idea to consider that there is no headphone jack, microphone input and video output, because there will already be a built-in microphone and speaker on the GoPro Hero 10.</p><p><strong>GoPro Hero 10 Black Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>GoPro Hero 10 Black specifications:</li><li>Higher video framerates</li><li>Top-of-the-line digital stabilization</li><li>WiFi and Bluetooth Supported</li><li>More effiecient wire transfer</li><li>Digital Image Stabilization</li><li>1720 mAh rechargeable battery capacity via USB type-C</li><li>The new lens cover can repel water</li><li>No tripod mount and accessory shoe</li><li>Better and improved user interface</li><li>Waterproof of upto 10m</li><li>Doubled processor power</li><li>Interval Recording</li><li>No built-in light&#x2F;flash</li><li>Creative Effects</li><li>Burst Mode</li></ul><h2 id="7-Nikon-Z6-II"><a href="#7-Nikon-Z6-II" class="headerlink" title="7. Nikon Z6 II"></a>7. Nikon Z6 II</h2><p>The Nikon Z6 II is equipped with a whopping 24-megapixel sensor, it lays perfectly between processing power and resolution, a lot of people like the option to the professional grade Nikon Z7 II which comes with about the double megapixel count. There are not many differences between this camera and its forerunner. A difference is “II” nomenclature after the Z6 mark. We figured that it’s just a couple of millimeters deeper. We know that the Z6 II is the cheaper model of the two, one is more-affordable and better designed compared to the more-expensive brother, the Z7 II. Nikon chose to keep both the Z6 and the Z7 in its range so there’s would not be a reason why the upgrades available wouldn’t fit you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/nikon-z6-ii.jpg"                      alt="nikon z6 ii"                ></p><p>We noticed that most of the Z6 II’s buttons are paired together to the right of the camera, so you can make changes with your fingers. The set of dials on the front and side of the grip feel natural to control aperture and its shutter speed. You see buttons for settings such as video recording, exposure compensation and ISO on the side. Even though there are no disappointments when talking about image quality. The Z6 II expresses the same sensor as its forerunner.</p><p>Personalize the controls on the Z6 II, on an attached lens and also on the body. You can navigate to the menu and configure these settings from there. In this camera model you also find the possibility to adjust how the focus ring acts on Z lenses (besides the Noct lens, which is not focus-by-wire). Because of the powered processing options comes a higher burst rate. We noticed an improved autofocus with support for Eye-AF in Wide Area AF modes.</p><p>To sum things up besides the specifications of this camera, we find this one of the most amazing full-frame mirrorless cameras available today. It has the lens mount and quality just right, despite the fact that is has much competition and considered not being a huge upgrade than the original model, the Z6 II is incredible in many way.</p><ul><li>Nikon Z6 II specifications:</li><li>Full-sensor UHD 4K video at up to 30p</li><li>24MP full-frame BSI-CMOS sensor</li><li>UHD 60p from an APS-C crop promised in future firmware

As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly. In the newer iPhone models like the iPhone 12 series, the software would not automatically save the regular and HDR versions if you set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>How to turn off HDR on your iPhone?</strong></p><p>Step1On your iPhone, open the Settings menu from the list of apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-2.jpg"                      alt="open the settings menu"                ></p><p>Step2Access the Camera tab.</p><p>Step3Under the HDR settings area, slide the toggle for Smart HDR to OFF.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                      alt="slide the toggle for smart hdr to off"                ></p><p>Step4On the regular Camera app, the yellow HDR icon will appear if you switch off Smart HDR.

You can add pre-set effects in the software package or adjust color grading in the videos. The two main color-related adjustments you can make are Color Correction and Color Match to sync the video visuals with zero washed-out look or distortions.</p><p>The only drawback here for editing Dolby Vision HDR footage is that it does not work directly on iPhones. You can make the edits on a Mac computer and then directly export them to iPhones. So, overall, using this software is the best option to try to <strong>convert HDR video to SDR iPhone,</strong> in our experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to edit iPhone HDR video using Filmora?</strong></p><p>Step1Install Filmora and launch the software on your Mac device.</p><p>Step2Click on New Project &gt; Click here to import media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-4.jpg"                      alt="click on new project"                ></p><p>Choose the HDR video from the iPhone device that you transferred to the device in QuickTime Movie format (MOV).</p><p>Step3Drag and drop the video to the timeline section for editing the file.</p><p>Step4Make the necessary edits like Color Matching and Chroma key-based background removal&#x2F;editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-5.jpg"                      alt="make edits"                ></p><p>Step5Click on the Export button on top of the screen.</p><p>Step6Go to the Device tab and choose iPhone.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a ().</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to video  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a ().</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to video  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro. You can fix the problem by disabling the HDR effect, using a high-quality video editor like Filmora, or changing the color codec.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-racing-hearts-22-short-track-triumph-for-2024/"><u>[New] Racing Hearts  '22 Short-Track Triumph for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-tips-for-transferring-media-files-flawlessly-w11/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Tips for Transferring Media Files Flawlessly W11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-investigating-financial-gains-from-product-reviews/"><u>2024 Approved  Investigating Financial Gains From Product Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-creating-stunning-3d-text-with-ps/"><u>[New] Creating Stunning 3D Text with PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-acid-pro-reviewed-comparable-professional-tools-explored/"><u>2024 Approved  ACID Pro Reviewed  Comparable Professional Tools Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pivoting-from-srt-to-subtitle-format/"><u>2024 Approved  Pivoting From SRT to Subtitle Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-superior-selection-best-windows-videophone-apps-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, Superior Selection  Best Windows Videophone Apps Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-explore-the-latest-in-video-compression-technology-with-these-46-new-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Explore the Latest in Video Compression Technology with These 46 New Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-mirthful-minutiae-handbook-compiling-genuine-guffaw-guideposts/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Mirthful Minutiae Handbook Compiling Genuine Guffaw Guideposts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/one-content-multiple-venues-captivate-through-youtube-and-twitch/"><u>One Content, Multiple Venues  Captivate Through Youtube & Twitch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-building-a-strong-network-how-to-form-effective-youtube-partner-relationships/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Building a Strong Network  How to Form Effective YouTube Partner Relationships</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-amplify-your-content-two-approaches-to-skyrocket-traffic/"><u>2024 Approved  Amplify Your Content  Two Approaches to Skyrocket Traffic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-xiaomi-13-ultra-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Xiaomi 13 Ultra to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-viral-mastery-in-10-simple-tiktok-steps/"><u>[Updated] Viral Mastery in 10 Simple TikTok Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/photoshops-quick-path-to-stunning-colors-for-2024/"><u>Photoshop's Quick Path to Stunning Colors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-flourishing-on-a-beauty-youtube-channel-for-2024/"><u>[New] Flourishing on a Beauty YouTube Channel for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-craft-selecting-the-top-5-web-based-title-makers/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Craft  Selecting the Top 5 Web-Based Title Makers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Pure color background"></a>1. Pure color background</h3><p>You can choose any clean and solid color wall, curtain, or wallpaper as a background for your live stream. But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.</p><p>It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-1.jpg"                      alt="pure color background"                ></p><h3 id="2-Neatly-organized-shelves"><a href="#2-Neatly-organized-shelves" class="headerlink" title="2. Neatly organized shelves"></a>2. Neatly organized shelves</h3><p>Another way is to choose well-organized and clean shelves as a background. For example, you can set a bookshelf as your background if you have to join some live business meetings or academic sessions.</p><p>Even if you are a seller showcasing his products during a live stream, you can select this type of background by placing the products you will introduce on any clean shelf. It will help you to make the viewer experience much better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-2.jpg"                      alt="neatly organized shelves"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-real-scene-with-warm-decoration"><a href="#3-The-real-scene-with-warm-decoration" class="headerlink" title="3. The real scene with warm decoration"></a>3. The real scene with warm decoration</h3><p>The realistic scenes with warm decorations can also be a beautiful background for your streams. They make your relationship with the viewers much more friendly and familiar. In other words, they give your stream a natural look, which fascinates the viewers very much.</p><p>One thing you guys should never forget is that you have to decorate the scene according to your stream category and characteristics. But not too many decorations are needed as it is much better if it looks natural.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-3.jpg"                      alt="the real scene with warm decoration"                ></p><h3 id="4-Virtual-backgrounds"><a href="#4-Virtual-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual backgrounds"></a>4. Virtual backgrounds</h3><p>This is the best option for gamers and technology streamers. Using this feature, you can change your background anytime with any beautiful wallpaper or image you want. They can give your viewers a better visual appearance and a trustful impression. That is why live streams are also very important for large businesses.</p><p>Also, there are two kinds of virtual backgrounds. The first is a static image in which you can directly upload the wallpaper you want. The second option is the green screen, which is preferable to the latter. Because it allows you to use much more appealing and awesome backgrounds in your stream, as well as more accurate image matting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-4.jpg"                      alt="virtual backgrounds"                ></p><h2 id="Part-II-5-tools-to-inspire-your-ideas-of-live-streaming-background"><a href="#Part-II-5-tools-to-inspire-your-ideas-of-live-streaming-background" class="headerlink" title="Part II. 5 tools to inspire your ideas of live streaming background"></a>Part II. 5 tools to inspire your ideas of live streaming background</h2><h3 id="1-Freepik"><a href="#1-Freepik" class="headerlink" title="1.

Designers rely on their practical experience to guide them, regardless of their level of schooling. If you have the desire to always learn new things and challenge yourself, you may be a graphic artist at heart. Although it’s a fascinating industry to enter, many aspiring designers can become bogged down in the early stages. This article will examine the profession of graphic design before outlining the ten stages necessary to become one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/graphic-design-career.jpg"                      alt="graphic design career"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Learn-Graphic-Designing"><a href="#Part-1-Learn-Graphic-Designing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Learn Graphic Designing"></a>Part 1. Learn Graphic Designing</h2><p>You must have a thorough understanding of graphic design principles before you can become a graphic designer. A well-made design takes time to create. It takes extensive planning as well as knowledge of how to apply design philosophy and principles. Lines, color, shape, space, texture, typography, scale, dominance and emphasis, and harmony are all factors that graphic designers must consider. Each of these factors has an effect on a design and influences how an audience feels. Here are a few methods to get started:</p><p><strong>Take a graphic design course</strong></p><p>A graphic design course teaches you the principles of design and aids in your skill development by having you work on projects. You’ll meet peers and mentors through graphic design courses, and they’ll be useful as you expand your network. Topics including color theory, typography, layout, and graphic design tools and software will likely be covered in the majority of graphic design courses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/take-graphic-design-course.jpg"                      alt="take graphic design course"                ></p><p>Some courses may also instruct you on the history of graphic design, user experience (UX), and website design principles, depending on their depth. There are several alternatives, ranging from academic courses with rigid structure to more flexible online courses. Find one that fits your learning style and timetable.</p><p><strong>Practice your design skills</strong></p><p>Remember, practice makes perfect. It’s time to put your newfound knowledge of graphic design ideas and tools into practice. Working on your own design projects is the best approach to develop your abilities and become a master of graphic design software. You might start by making imitation advertisements and company logos for real or imagined businesses.</p><p>In order to discover and design for target consumers, you may also use a current company’s designs as inspiration for a new design. Volunteering for regional nonprofits or businesses is another choice. Give these organizations your design expertise to obtain additional practice and practical experience.</p><p><strong>Create a portfolio</strong></p><p>Any graphic designer must have a strong portfolio. Projects you did for a course as well as personal or professional projects can be included in your portfolio. Pay attention to quality over quantity. Since your portfolio will serve as potential employers’ or clients’ initial impression of you, choose pieces that highlight your design expertise and passions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Find-Clients"><a href="#Part-2-Find-Clients" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

With the help of its Enterprise feature, it may connect sizable teams of independent contractors for collaborative working in addition to matching a client with a designer.</p><p><strong>Toptal</strong></p><p>Toptal is a US-based company that connects businesses in need of freelance skills with designers.

Clients publish their project specifications, and freelancers respond with quotes or bids outlining how much they would charge to do the task or provide the service. At any time, clients can choose the freelancers they want to work with and start a project with them.</p><p><strong>SimplyHired</strong></p><p>Online hiring is made possible by the website and mobile app Simply Hired. Although primarily geared at full-time employment, it also offers the chance to find companies in need of design assistance, giving you the opportunity to obtain that all-important first foot in the door.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Much-Do-Graphic-Designers-Get-Paid"><a href="#Part-3-How-Much-Do-Graphic-Designers-Get-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The BLS reports that the median annual compensation for graphic designers working in the advertising, public relations, and allied services sector in 2020 was slightly higher ($55,800) than that of graphic designers employed in other common industries like printing and publishing.</p><p>The following countries are great for graphic designers:</p><p><strong>The United Kingdom</strong></p><p>In the UK, business is booming in the design sector. In actuality, the design and designer fashion sectors’ gross value added (GVA) reached £2.52 billion, or $3.35 billion, in 2018. With many top-tier agencies based in London and Glasgow, the UK is one of the world’s major design hubs.</p><p>The UK is one of the most alluring nations for American designers for a number of reasons. There are no linguistic obstacles, on the one hand. However, the cost of living in the UK is 12.21% lower than it is in the US. It implies that housing costs are lower there. However, one of the nations with the highest incomes for graphic design is the United Kingdom. The best paid cities are the bigger ones like London, where the average yearly wage is $72,500.</p><p><strong>Canada</strong></p><p>Despite having a relatively tiny population for such a vast country in terms of area, Canada does have a vibrant design culture. The national average compensation for graphic designers is $48,750 per year. As in other countries, the necessity to streamline brand assets across numerous media has increased demand for designers, especially those with expertise in multiple design disciplines.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>According to an interesting fact, China had the highest percentage of smartphone users in the world in 2020. It surpasses Indonesia, the United States, and India with a penetration rate of 60.75 percent. China has a sizable and loyal mobile user base. Mobile design and development are thus one of the top objectives in the nation.</p><p>Particularly Shenzhen is a recognized design capital and one of the top cities for innovation and the creative industries. It has financing to support local startups and is recognized as a City of Design. Using the Creative Cities Network.</p><p>In Shenzhen, 6,000 design firms employ almost 100,000 workers. Graphic designers in China get an average salary of $1276 per year, according to Payscale. Chinese graphic design salaries are lower than those in the US.</p><p>The Red Dragon, on the other hand, has a lower cost of living than America—in fact, it is 34.1 percent less expensive. You would make a good living and have a big wage if you moved to the country.</p><p><strong>Israel</strong></p><p>Israel’s entrepreneurial community is flourishing. In fact, among the top 30 worldwide startup ecosystems and runners-up, Tel Aviv comes in at number six. This makes it an appealing option for many design industry experts, especially when combined with the nation’s high-tech mindset.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Choose-the-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Choose-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Choose the Software"></a>Part 4. Choose the Software</h2><p>The best graphic design software for you might depend on your needs, but if you work with a variety of clients and require a wide range of features, you might want to stick with one of the most well-known programs. Based on our own assessments, we’ve selected the best graphic design software currently on the market. This list includes everything from general-purpose software packages to specialized solutions for specialized markets. We have created a list for you to check out when looking for graphic designer software.</p><p><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></p><p>There isn’t much reason to seek further if you want the greatest graphic design program for vector drawing and editing. Adobe Illustrator. For a good reason—we think it still provides the most robust selection of tools and functionality for vector editing—it is still the industry standard software.</p><p>Illustrator lets you to design everything from graphics to logos with complete creative freedom while having a ton of tools and shortcuts to help speed up your workflow. It is compatible with PC, Mac, and even iPads. We were happy with several of the improvements Adobe made to maintain their throne, including the ability to customize the toolbar, Rotate View, and a Width Tool that makes it simple to add variations to vector lines.</p><p><strong>Affinity Designer</strong></p><p>Serif’s Affinity Designer is a very capable substitute if you think Adobe’s membership pricing structure is a touch too much. Affinity Designer is the best graphic design software you can buy for a one-time fee, and as it continues to add capabilities, it is almost on par with Illustrator in popularity. In fact, it provides various tools not found in Illustrator, such as unlimited redo’s and a zoom of more than one million percent.</p><p>If coworkers or clients use Adobe products, you don’t have to worry about compatibility because Affinity Designer supports both Illustrator AI and Photoshop PSD files. Affinity Designer probably runs quicker than Adobe Illustrator as well.</p><p><strong>CorelDRAW</strong></p><p>Although Adobe Illustrator gained some of CorelDRAW’s early popularity, it still has a devoted following, and the software’s 2021 update brought about several significant improvements. A Mac version (opens in new tab), which was previously only available for Windows, became available in 2019, helping to increase the package’s appeal by adding many of Illustrator’s features at a somewhat lower cost. Since you have the option of making a one-time payment or a subscription, you also have additional financial flexibility.</p><p>In spite of this, importing and exporting AI and PDF files to CorelDRAW is trouble-free. However, you should select one over the other mostly because you like the interface and process better. We advise joining up for the free trials of both if you haven’t used either before or have the opportunity to compare them.</p><p><strong>Gravit Designer</strong></p><p>The best free vector-specific graphic design program comes from the makers of Corel Draw and is called Gravit Designer. It can handle the majority of design tasks, from icon design and prototyping to vector drawing and animation, thanks to its clear and user-friendly interface. With the free version, you can access your work from anywhere using the Gravit Cloud and export files as PDF, SVG, or bitmaps.</p><p>You can download a copy of Gravit Designer or use it online. When you sign up, Gravit Designer Pro automatically starts as a free trial; after that, you automatically switch to the free edition, losing the pro capabilities unless you pay for a subscription.</p><p><strong>SVG-Edit</strong></p><p>Using a common vector toolkit, SVG-Edit enables you to edit and generate SVG files. No download is necessary because the software operates directly in your web browser. It isn’t the most complete vector software, but that isn’t really necessary. It will work just fine for vectors that are straightforward or even a little more intricate.</p><p><strong>VectorStyler</strong></p><p>The best vector software includes VectorStyler, a very recent addition. It was initially exclusively accessible for Mac, but it is now also available for Windows. A large selection of scalable vector brushes and the addition of some capabilities that are absent from other Adobe Illustrator competitors, like a form builder, a blend tool, and a pattern tool, are some of its main selling points. It can open and import Illustrator files, and you can import AI brush collections, make vector brushes out of artwork, and dynamically link brush content to editable artwork. You can even generate vector brushes from scratch.</p><p><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></p><p>Most likely, you already know that Adobe Photoshop is the industry-standard program for manipulating images. The program has long been well-known, and just as Illustrator continues to be the greatest vector design software due to its frequent improvements, Photoshop continues to rule in picture manipulation.</p><p>In actuality, it is capable of far more than just image manipulation, including photo retouching, digital painting and drawing, 3D modeling, and user experience design. It is a fully functional program, and Adobe has been expanding its arsenal of AI capabilities under the Adobe Sensei brand so that you can quickly and easily remove backdrops, for example.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Working-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-5-Working-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Working in Teams"></a>Part 5. Working in Teams</h2><p>The effort of several specialists with expertise in disciplines like graphic design, animation, and coding is frequently required for today’s designs. Whether you’re working on a project with two individuals or twenty, improving your team design strategy will streamline your operations and produce better results. Although the skills and personality of your team members may affect how projects are designed, you can usually rely on the following procedures to increase the effectiveness of your work.</p><p>During the team design project, don’t presume that everyone will play a particular position. Knowing everyone’s strengths can help you assign work to them as you progress through the design phases rather than making them sit idle.</p><p>Your illustrator may have prior animation experience. Your illustrator may even have expertise with development in the workplace of today. Even though they lack the necessary expertise to create a website or app, they could be able to advance the project’s initial phase with their rudimentary understanding. The team’s workflow will be accelerated, and your job satisfaction as an illustrator will increase.</p><p>Some people may feel isolated as a result of team design. They might eventually begin to procrastinate on their work, arrive at meetings a little late, or forget to check their messages. Negative feedback would be used in a conventional project management strategy to hold team members accountable.</p><p>You might have to huddle up with some individuals as the project manager to criticize their mistakes. But really, that ought to be your final resort. Utilize positive reinforcement prior to using negative reinforcement to keep team members motivated and appreciated.</p><p>You might not always have the opportunity to assemble your team in one location as more businesses migrate staff and independent contractors to remote employment. The warmth of in-person collaboration will be missed by some. However, working remotely is growing common. Even once the coronavirus pandemic is over, almost 70% of business owners anticipate letting at least some of their staff work remotely.</p><p>On any design job, effective communication is essential. However, if you can’t solve the fundamental issues with remote working, no amount of communication will be of any use. Some of us are entering a completely new world. It’s still beneficial to learn more about how you may succeed in a remote work setting with a team of graphic designers in particular, even if you’ve been working remotely for some time.</p><p>Leading a team at work involves more than just ensuring that everyone provides for your needs. The best managers pay close attention to the long-term requirements of those under their control. Give your team members the resources and opportunities they require to achieve their own professional goals if you want to get the most out of them. Assist them in finding a path that has upward momentum.</p><p>Understanding the individuals you deal with and allocating tasks based on that understanding are both important aspects of managing your graphic design team effectively. Try to assign assignments as much as you can based on who would be the best fit for the job. While some tasks must be completed regardless of whether they are fun or not, doing too much tedious work makes people lose interest in their employment.</p><p>A crucial component of creative activity is engaging others in their work. In general, employees who are more invested in their work will perform better over time.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The world of graphic design depends on relationships with other people to advance. Therefore, being really nice and engaged will undoubtedly advance your career. Simply put, communication and relationship-building are essential to our line of work, so you can’t avoid them. One last bit of advice is to keep going. Continue phoning, sending emails, or doing whatever else you do regularly. Reject jealousy and don’t take rejection personally. A rejection today can lead to a job tomorrow or a future new client.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capacity-of-64128gb-in-video-storage-an-overview/"><u>2024 Approved  Capacity of 64/128GB in Video Storage -

GIFs offer an endless source of fun, and it is only reasonable that some iPhone owners want to create GIF collections on their phones.</p><p><strong>You May Also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best 10 GIF Apps for iPhone &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p> In this tutorial, we will show you how you can save GIFs from any other social media platform like Tumblr, Twitter, and share them with your friends via messages or emails directly from your iPhone.</p><h2 id="How-to-Download-and-Save-GIFs-on-an-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Download-and-Save-GIFs-on-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Download and Save GIFs on an iPhone"></a>How to Download and Save GIFs on an iPhone</h2><p> Regardless of which version iOS you have on your iPhone, saving GIFs on your device isn’t complicated at all, but some older versions of iOS require third-party apps in order to be able to play GIFs.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Section 1: iOS 11 Users:</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Section 2: iOS 10 or Earlier:</a></li></ul><h3 id="Section-1-iOS-11-Users"><a href="#Section-1-iOS-11-Users" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: iOS 11 Users"></a>Section 1: iOS 11 Users</h3><p> After waiting for so long iPhone owners can finally enjoy the benefits of the GIFs feature in the Photos app. These simple steps will show you how to save any GIF you like in just a few taps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you’ve found a GIF you’d like to store on your phone, tap on the image and hold until the menu appears on the screen, and then pick the Save GIF option, to save it on your Camera Roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-album.PNG"                                     ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now that the GIF is saved on your iPhone, you can always access it from the Photos app. Your GIF collection is located in the Animated folder, and if at any point you would like to take a look at a GIF you saved, you can just open the Animated folder. Simply tap on any GIF to display it in full-screen mode, but if the GIF isn’t stored locally on your iPhone you’ll need to wait for a few seconds until it’s downloaded from the iCloud Photo Library.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-gif.PNG"                                     ></p><h3 id="Section-2-iOS-10-or-Earlier"><a href="#Section-2-iOS-10-or-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: iOS 10 or Earlier"></a>Section 2: iOS 10 or Earlier</h3><p> The process of saving a GIF on iOS 10 or earlier versions of iOS is virtually the same as the one on iOS 11.

This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips"></a>Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips</h2><p><strong>Never forget to take test shots:-</strong> You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.</p><p>As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Leading-Meaningful-Conversations-An-Interviewer’s-Journey"><a href="#Leading-Meaningful-Conversations-An-Interviewer’s-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Leading Meaningful Conversations: An Interviewer’s Journey"></a>Leading Meaningful Conversations: An Interviewer’s Journey</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p><p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p><h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p><p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p><h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p><p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p><h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p><p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p><p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p><h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p><p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p><h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p><p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p><p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p><h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6. Keep it simple"></a>6. Keep it simple</h2><p>It’s simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you’re just starting out, the opposite is typically true.</p><p>Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you’ve written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.</p><p>You’ll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.</p><h2 id="7-Create-a-stunning-intro"><a href="#7-Create-a-stunning-intro" class="headerlink" title="7. Create a stunning intro"></a>7. Create a stunning intro</h2><p>For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.</p><p>Make a YouTube opening that’s decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/explore-top-5-non-samsung-360-cameras-today/"><u>Explore Top 5 Non-Samsung 360 Cameras Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-adding-youtube-music-to-video/"><u>2024 Approved  Adding YouTube Music To Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-fading-sound-tracks-with-logic-pro/"><u>[Updated] Fading Sound Tracks with Logic Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-podcast-dominance-through-powerful-seo-tactics/"><u>2024 Approved  Podcast Dominance Through Powerful SEO Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-new-horizinas-in-the-world-of-srt/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating New Horizinas in the World of SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/quick-fix-guide-repair-and-enhance-your-iphoneipadmacs-airdrop-for-2024/"><u>Quick-Fix Guide  Repair and Enhance Your iPhone/iPad/Mac's AirDrop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-complete-guide-to-sourcing-elite-instagram-ringtones-and-designing-noteworthy-ringtone-alarms/"><u>2024 Approved  A Complete Guide to Sourcing Elite Instagram Ringtones & Designing Noteworthy Ringtone Alarms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-peering-into-the-pinnacle-of-4k-monitoring-with-lgs-ultrafine-display/"><u>In 2024, Peering Into the Pinnacle of 4K Monitoring with LG’s UltraFine Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-solve-youtube-app-crashing-on-realme-narzo-n53-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Solutions to Solve YouTube App Crashing on Realme Narzo N53 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hilarity-highway-the-funniest-youtube-videos-on-twitter/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Hilarity Highway  The Funniest YouTube Videos on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/clashing-kings-the-top-battle-royale-games/"><u>Clashing Kings  The Top Battle Royale Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-ranking-the-most-accessible-video-chat-applications-top-10-for-businesses-and-schools/"><u>[New] Ranking the Most Accessible Video Chat Applications  Top 10 For Businesses & Schools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/uniting-visuals-the-art-of-video-sequence-composition/"><u>Uniting Visuals  The Art of Video Sequence Composition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-honor-90-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Honor 90 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-comprehensive-strategies-for-tracking-yt-traffic-and-gains/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Comprehensive Strategies for Tracking YT Traffic and Gains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-transform-videos-into-stunning-live-photos-with-these-apps/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Transform Videos Into Stunning Live Photos with These Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-foremost-10-video-subtitling-services-online/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Foremost 10 Video Subtitling Services Online</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-to-Superior-Cloud-Solutions-for-Your-Needs"><a href="#Navigating-to-Superior-Cloud-Solutions-for-Your-Needs" class="headerlink" title="Navigating to Superior Cloud Solutions for Your Needs"></a>Navigating to Superior Cloud Solutions for Your Needs</h2><p>We will steer you on the correct path by describing <strong>cloud storage</strong>, how cloud storage may help you, and how to find the appropriate provider for your needs, regardless of whether you are a novice to cloud storage or an experienced veteran. For those wanting to learn more about <strong>cloud storage services</strong> read through our extensive list we have reviewed to this point.</p><p>However, if you are just interested in the best providers, we have evaluated them according to various criteria, including capacity, security, and simplicity of use. We have mainly concentrated on providing great paid solutions for individuals and small organizations. So, let us begin our journey to the <strong>best cloud storage for personal use</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-1.jpg"                      alt="beat cloud storage"                ></p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">iCloud (iPhone &amp; Mac)</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Google Drive</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Flickr</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Wondershare Drive</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">IDRIVE</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-The-Overall-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service"><a href="#Part-1-The-Overall-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Overall Best Cloud Storage Service"></a>Part 1: The Overall Best Cloud Storage Service</h2><h3 id="No-1-iCloud-iPhone-Mac"><a href="#No-1-iCloud-iPhone-Mac" class="headerlink" title="No.1 iCloud (iPhone &amp; Mac)"></a>No.1 iCloud (iPhone &amp; Mac)</h3><p>Compared to other <strong>cloud storage services</strong>, Apple’s iCloud operates a little differently because of its effective integration into both macOS and iOS. You can access it through Windows PCs, but honestly, the only scenario in which it makes sense to use it is if you typically work with Apple gear. In addition to the files, images, and videos kept on your iPhone or iPad, iCloud also stores your messages, calendars, contacts, and a variety of other data.</p><p>Once the service is active, you won’t need to make any adjustments since most of what is occurring are behind the scenes, which is one of the benefits of this. In addition, when the time comes for you to upgrade to a new Apple device, you will be able to instantly sync all of the information from your previous device within a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: Reasonable price</strong></p><p>Even if the 5 GB of free storage space that comes with iCloud won’t meet your needs, particularly if you want to capture photographs and movies, you can purchase more storage space at more affordable costs. These are as follows: 50 GB for $0.99 (or £0.79 per month), 200 GB for $2.99 (or £2.49 per month), and 2 TB for $9.99 (or $6.99 per month), with the latter two choices, also being eligible for inclusion in Apple’s Family Sharing feature.</p><p><strong>Reason2: Great data security</strong></p><p>You may even collaborate on papers while protecting them with a password. Two-factor authentication is supported. If you sign up for an iCloud+ subscription, Apple will provide you with iCloud Private Relay so that you may browse the internet without worrying about your privacy. Hide My Email; allows you to generate temporary email addresses rather than reveal your own. And HomeKit Secure Video; if you have a HomeKit security camera or video doorbell, these two apps may help you keep your personal information private.</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great connectivity for apple family users.</strong></p><p>It allows for excellent communication with both close friends and relatives. With iOS 16, the iCloud Shared Photo Library is now accessible on iPhones and other Apple products. This function, which allows family members in the library to share images on iCloud as they are taken, may be switched on or off with a flip of the switch inside the camera app.</p><h3 id="No-2-Google-Drive"><a href="#No-2-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="No.2 Google Drive"></a>No.2 Google Drive</h3><p>If you already have a Google account, you are automatically entitled to 15 GB of free storage space in Google Drive. You may use this to create backups of important files, such as documents, images, movies, and anything else you want to keep secure.</p><p>The user interface of Drive is uncluttered, straightforward, and only takes about a minute to get used to. It offers helpful capabilities such as sharing URLs to folders (while selecting the amount of control the receiver has), viewing a file even if opened on another device, plus applications for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. However, this does not mean that Drive <strong>cloud storage</strong> is simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-3.jpg"                      alt="google drive"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: easy to get</strong></p><p>The cloud storage service provided by Google, known as Google Drive, is straightforward to use. Do you own an Android-based device? It is a standard feature. Have you got a Google account? You can get to it using your browser. There are official programs available for both the Mac and iOS platforms, as well as a large number of third-party apps that support Drive. The seamless integration of Drive with the rest of Google’s products is a standout feature. It is possible to create, edit, and share cloud files with others using Google Sheets, Docs, and Slides without ever having to download anything. This feature is limited to previewing Office documents.</p><p><strong>Reason2: free 15GB space</strong></p><p>The free plan offers an industry-leading 15 GB of <strong>cloud storage service</strong>. Users can access even more space via third-party applications (Google Photos specifically stores HD photos, for example). Subscribe to the paid Google One service if you find that 15 GB of storage is insufficient. You can select 100 GB for $1.99 or £1.59&#x2F;month, 200 GB for $2.99 or £2.49 per month, 2 TB for $9.99 or £7.99&#x2F;month, all the way up to 30 TB for a magnificent price of $299.99 or £239.99&#x2F;month (a fraction of what Amazon charges for 30 TB!).</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great Connectivity</strong></p><p>Regarding the fundamentals of <strong>personal cloud storage</strong>, Google Drive delivers features such as simple access to data from applications and your browser, the option to recover older versions of files, and offline access when not connected to the Internet. But there is some bad news as well. The syncing process is not as straightforward as it is with some of the company’s rivals, and there is no end-to-end encryption. This means that Google could, in principle, see your data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures"></a>Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures</h2><p>Saving your best images and shots is a must. After all, you never know when you will need that school get-together pictures for an event.</p><p>Thus, here is the <strong>best cloud storage for personal use</strong>.</p><h3 id="Flickr"><a href="#Flickr" class="headerlink" title="Flickr"></a>Flickr</h3><p>Flickr <strong>cloud storage</strong> has been around for a long time and was once considered one of the most outstanding internet services for uploading images and videos. Several companies have owned it, and SmugMug has been the current owner s ince April 20, 2018. You don’t need to sign up to see images and videos on Flickr, but if you want to post anything to the website, you will need to sign up for an account first. A user may add another Flickr user as a contact after making an account with the website. This allows the user to construct a profile page that displays photographs and videos that the user has posted to the website. Flickr provides mobile users with official mobile applications for iOS and Android, in addition to a mobile site optimized for usage on mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr"                ></p><p><strong>Free 1000-picture storage</strong></p><p>Free <strong>cloud storage services</strong> for up to 1000 images and videos are available via Flickr. However, the restriction depends on the number of photographs rather than the storage size. You may upload your pictures in total, uncompressed splendor without worrying about conserving space.</p><p><strong>Unlimited storage for premium users.</strong></p><p>If you think that 1,000 images won’t be enough, you have the option to subscribe for simply $7.99 more each month. It is worth considering that it already provides unlimited storage and removes all advertisements from your experience. You will not need to update your system a second time to get an additional terabyte of storage space.</p><p><strong>Other features.</strong></p><p>Flickr provides a sharing link for images and albums and the ability to manage the groups of people who may see your photos. Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, “star” them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads. You can get more out of your Flickr account by connecting it to third-party applications and sharing your photographs on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler. You can examine how many views your images have received and determine their credit rights.</p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos"></a>Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><h3 id="Wondershare-Drive"><a href="#Wondershare-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Drive"></a>Wondershare Drive</h3><p>The Wondershare Drive is the <strong>best cloud storage</strong> platform that caters to those who create both work and content. You can save images, movies, files, and other stuff in a secure manner, as well as share it without being limited by the device. An essential feature is that you can upload the project you are working on in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the Wondershare Drive. This will allow you to edit films regardless of where you are. You may manage files stored in Wondershare Drive in Filmora or by going to <a class="link"   href="https://drive-web.wondershare.com/" >https://drive-web.wondershare.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You also can upload files using this page. In addition, you can do fundamental administration tasks inside the drive, such as relocating, renaming, erasing, and downloading data. Even you can highlight the crucial files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-5.jpg"                      alt="wondershare drive"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-The-Cloud-Storage-Service-with-Best-Price"><a href="#Part-4-The-Cloud-Storage-Service-with-Best-Price" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price"></a>Part 4: The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price</h2><h3 id="IDRIVE"><a href="#IDRIVE" class="headerlink" title="IDRIVE"></a>IDRIVE</h3><p>Have a lot of expensive documents to safeguard?</p><p>IDrive comes out on top as the most acceptable <strong>cloud storage</strong> option because of its superb backup features, user-friendly applications, high level of data protection, and competitive pricing. There are notable characteristics for every user, like:</p><p>You are free to install IDrive on as many different devices as you choose. Plus, if you make changes to a file on one of your devices and then sync it to the others, the changes will take effect immediately.</p><p>In addition, extensive backup options make it possible to save anything from individual files and folders to create a whole image of your device, facilitating straightforward recovery in the event of a catastrophe. (If you have a terrible internet connection and the file will take a long time to download, IDrive can even give you a physical drive with all your data, which is a huge advantage.)</p><p>Two-factor authentication safeguards your account no matter what you’re up to, and end-to-end encryption makes it impossible for anybody to acquire even a whiff of the information you’ve stored there.</p><p>However, if you are not the technical type, don’t worry. You can set up IDrive in a matter of moments and forget it’s there, allowing the service to do its job.

You can access it through Windows PCs, but honestly, the only scenario in which it makes sense to use it is if you typically work with Apple gear. In addition to the files, images, and videos kept on your iPhone or iPad, iCloud also stores your messages, calendars, contacts, and a variety of other data.</p><p>Once the service is active, you won’t need to make any adjustments since most of what is occurring are behind the scenes, which is one of the benefits of this. In addition, when the time comes for you to upgrade to a new Apple device, you will be able to instantly sync all of the information from your previous device within a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: Reasonable price</strong></p><p>Even if the 5 GB of free storage space that comes with iCloud won’t meet your needs, particularly if you want to capture photographs and movies, you can purchase more storage space at more affordable costs. These are as follows: 50 GB for $0.99 (or £0.79 per month), 200 GB for $2.99 (or £2.49 per month), and 2 TB for $9.99 (or $6.99 per month), with the latter two choices, also being eligible for inclusion in Apple’s Family Sharing feature.</p><p><strong>Reason2: Great data security</strong></p><p>You may even collaborate on papers while protecting them with a password. Two-factor authentication is supported. If you sign up for an iCloud+ subscription, Apple will provide you with iCloud Private Relay so that you may browse the internet without worrying about your privacy. Hide My Email; allows you to generate temporary email addresses rather than reveal your own. And HomeKit Secure Video; if you have a HomeKit security camera or video doorbell, these two apps may help you keep your personal information private.</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great connectivity for apple family users.</strong></p><p>It allows for excellent communication with both close friends and relatives. With iOS 16, the iCloud Shared Photo Library is now accessible on iPhones and other Apple products. This function, which allows family members in the library to share images on iCloud as they are taken, may be switched on or off with a flip of the switch inside the camera app.</p><h3 id="No-2-Google-Drive-1"><a href="#No-2-Google-Drive-1" class="headerlink" title="No.2 Google Drive"></a>No.2 Google Drive</h3><p>If you already have a Google account, you are automatically entitled to 15 GB of free storage space in Google Drive. You may use this to create backups of important files, such as documents, images, movies, and anything else you want to keep secure.</p><p>The user interface of Drive is uncluttered, straightforward, and only takes about a minute to get used to. It offers helpful capabilities such as sharing URLs to folders (while selecting the amount of control the receiver has), viewing a file even if opened on another device, plus applications for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. However, this does not mean that Drive <strong>cloud storage</strong> is simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-3.jpg"                      alt="google drive"                ></p><p><strong>Reason1: easy to get</strong></p><p>The cloud storage service provided by Google, known as Google Drive, is straightforward to use. Do you own an Android-based device? It is a standard feature. Have you got a Google account? You can get to it using your browser. There are official programs available for both the Mac and iOS platforms, as well as a large number of third-party apps that support Drive. The seamless integration of Drive with the rest of Google’s products is a standout feature. It is possible to create, edit, and share cloud files with others using Google Sheets, Docs, and Slides without ever having to download anything. This feature is limited to previewing Office documents.</p><p><strong>Reason2: free 15GB space</strong></p><p>The free plan offers an industry-leading 15 GB of <strong>cloud storage service</strong>. Users can access even more space via third-party applications (Google Photos specifically stores HD photos, for example). Subscribe to the paid Google One service if you find that 15 GB of storage is insufficient. You can select 100 GB for $1.99 or £1.59&#x2F;month, 200 GB for $2.99 or £2.49 per month, 2 TB for $9.99 or £7.99&#x2F;month, all the way up to 30 TB for a magnificent price of $299.99 or £239.99&#x2F;month (a fraction of what Amazon charges for 30 TB!).</p><p><strong>Reason3: Great Connectivity</strong></p><p>Regarding the fundamentals of <strong>personal cloud storage</strong>, Google Drive delivers features such as simple access to data from applications and your browser, the option to recover older versions of files, and offline access when not connected to the Internet. But there is some bad news as well. The syncing process is not as straightforward as it is with some of the company’s rivals, and there is no end-to-end encryption. This means that Google could, in principle, see your data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures-1"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures"></a>Part 2: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Pictures</h2><p>Saving your best images and shots is a must.

Several companies have owned it, and SmugMug has been the current owner s ince April 20, 2018. You don’t need to sign up to see images and videos on Flickr, but if you want to post anything to the website, you will need to sign up for an account first. A user may add another Flickr user as a contact after making an account with the website. This allows the user to construct a profile page that displays photographs and videos that the user has posted to the website. Flickr provides mobile users with official mobile applications for iOS and Android, in addition to a mobile site optimized for usage on mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr"                ></p><p><strong>Free 1000-picture storage</strong></p><p>Free <strong>cloud storage services</strong> for up to 1000 images and videos are available via Flickr. However, the restriction depends on the number of photographs rather than the storage size. You may upload your pictures in total, uncompressed splendor without worrying about conserving space.</p><p><strong>Unlimited storage for premium users.</strong></p><p>If you think that 1,000 images won’t be enough, you have the option to subscribe for simply $7.99 more each month. It is worth considering that it already provides unlimited storage and removes all advertisements from your experience. You will not need to update your system a second time to get an additional terabyte of storage space.</p><p><strong>Other features.</strong></p><p>Flickr provides a sharing link for images and albums and the ability to manage the groups of people who may see your photos. Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, “star” them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads. You can get more out of your Flickr account by connecting it to third-party applications and sharing your photographs on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler. You can examine how many views your images have received and determine their credit rights.</p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-The-Best-Cloud-Storage-Service-for-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos"></a>Part 3: The Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><h3 id="Wondershare-Drive-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Drive-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Drive"></a>Wondershare Drive</h3><p>The Wondershare Drive is the <strong>best cloud storage</strong> platform that caters to those who create both work and content.
