Using a Spyglass"></a>Way 4. Using a Spyglass</h2><p>In Minecraft, the spyglass is used to zoom in so that a player may see well at a greater distance than is typically feasible. This is incredibly helpful while exploring diverse biomes since it enhances your eyesight and makes it simple to find monsters or precious materials that are hidden from view. Players may now create a zooming item in Minecraft. The new Spyglass item that enables users to zoom in on certain places was introduced to Minecraft in the 1.17 release. The spyglass is a creatable item in Minecraft that enables users to alter their Field of Vision anytime they want to without visiting the settings page. On your Minecraft crafting table, you may create a spyglass.</p><p>Step1 Create a Spyglass by following the newest version guide of Minecraft.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-spyglass.jpg"                      alt="create a spyglass"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925468/19272" target="_top" id="1925468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925468/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 After that, put the Spyglass you just created in your menu bar and take a hold of it.

The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly.

In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta"><a href="#1-Meta" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft"><a href="#2-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games"><a href="#3-Epic-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready. Below are discussed metaverse devices that are crucial for such transportation.</p><h3 id="1-Computer-PC"><a href="#1-Computer-PC" class="headerlink" title="1. Computer (PC)"></a>1. Computer (PC)</h3><p>Laying your hands on a perfectly functioning computer device is one of the first necessities. Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><h3 id="2-Smartphone"><a href="#2-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2. Smartphone"></a>2. Smartphone</h3><p>Smartphones are the next important metaverse device with chipmakers like Qualcomm, Samsung already sharing their dedication to the mobile metaverse segment. Smartphones with the hardware they already come with are useful though for enjoying some of the games and platforms that use augmented reality.</p><h3 id="3-5G-Mobile-Networks"><a href="#3-5G-Mobile-Networks" class="headerlink" title="3.5G Mobile Networks"></a>3.5G Mobile Networks</h3><p>For metaverse to really get under one’s skin, one needs a powerful and lightning-fast network that 5G technology promises. Extensive penetration of 5G mobile networks is therefore extremely important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-5g-network.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device 5G Network"                ></p><p>Source: firstpoint-mg.com</p><h3 id="4-AR-Glasses"><a href="#4-AR-Glasses" class="headerlink" title="4.

These are smart wearables and help in embodied experiences.</p><h3 id="5-VR-Headset"><a href="#5-VR-Headset" class="headerlink" title="5. VR Headset"></a>5. VR Headset</h3><p>Virtual Reality (VR) headsets make use of technologies such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, etc along with a stereoscopic head-mounted display that provides separate images for each eye.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new.

Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft-3"><a href="#2-Microsoft-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games-3"><a href="#3-Epic-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready.

Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><h3 id="2-Smartphone-3"><a href="#2-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-conquer-iphone-audiophiles-playlist-tips/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Conquer iPhone Audiophile's Playlist Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-avoiding-compression-larger-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] Avoiding Compression Larger YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-bring-laughter-to-life-kapwing-creator-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bring Laughter to Life – Kapwing Creator for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-mastery-in-voice-change-with-morphvox-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastery in Voice Change with MorphVOX for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-eerie-engineer-zombie-joke-makers/"><u>[Updated] Eerie Engineer Zombie Joke Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-pc-skills-must-know-windows-tips-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your PC Skills Must-Know Windows Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vidtwitter-effortless-video-downloads-from-social-sites/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, VidTwitter Effortless Video Downloads From Social Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-premiere-pro-fullscreen-mode-essentials/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Premiere Pro Fullscreen Mode Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-direct-sharing-twitch-live-links-for-facebook-friends/"><u>2024 Approved Direct Sharing Twitch Live Links for Facebook Friends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-nokia-c210-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Nokia C210 Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-latest-guide-how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-note-12r-frp-without-computer-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Latest Guide How To Bypass Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP Without Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-audio-quality-for-your-youtube-channel/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting Audio Quality for Your YouTube Channel</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136618/26400" target="_top" id="2136618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136618/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Quick-Cut-Cinematic-Concept"><a href="#Quick-Cut-Cinematic-Concept" class="headerlink" title="Quick Cut Cinematic Concept"></a>Quick Cut Cinematic Concept</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3.

And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website.

As the word ‘Focus’ itself defines as centre of interest, it helps to keep our image subject as the main part by emphasizing and giving attention to exactly what we want to capture in the image. But how many of you have come across a situation where iPhone camera focus fails to work. An out of focus photography clearly looks clumsy as due to the blurriness. The iPhone camera not focusing issue usually appears and many people get annoyed by unclear picture. Thus, with the help of this article, we will make you aware about some tips you can attempt to fix the issue.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Stand too close is not good</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part4: Upgrade iOS</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part5: Turn off your iPhone</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-The-Easiest-Way—Auto-Focus"><a href="#Part1-The-Easiest-Way—Auto-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus"></a>Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus</h2><p> When you are getting troubles with iPhone camera focus, perhaps you are trying to focus a subject other than someone’s face. Putting it simply, iPhone camera’s autofocus feature is designed to make it powerful enough to read the face and focus it automatically. If there is no face, the iPhone will focus on the center itself. There is a yellow squared box which will let you identify the focusing part. But having the subject at the center is not necessary every time. If this is the case, you need to simply tap on the same part of the srceen where the subject is and the camera app will begin focusing on it. Check if it works or else go down to the next tip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/auto-focus.jpg"                      alt="auto focus"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-Lock-AE-AF"><a href="#Part2-Lock-AE-AF" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF"></a>Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF</h2><p> As in the above tip, we explained to tap on the srceen where you wish to set the focus. However, sometimes, single tapping on the srceen isn’t sufficient. This is because if any kind of movement happens in the scene or if you move, the camera will start re-adjusting its focus which obviously you don’t want. If you seriously want to take a better picture, make sure to lock the focus on the subject in the scene. This can be done by enabling AE&#x2F;AF feature and doing this will keep the focus on the subject even if anything moves in the scene. To do this, just tap and hold on the subject for a few seconds until you get to see a yellow box at the top of the srceen saying “AE&#x2F;AF LOCK”. Once you notice, you can release your fingers and start having fun with picture capturing moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ae-lock.jpg"                      alt="auto focus"                ></p><h2 id="Part3-Stand-too-close-is-not-good"><a href="#Part3-Stand-too-close-is-not-good" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Stand too close is not good"></a>Part3: Stand too close is not good</h2><p> If you are not getting standard iPhone focus, check if you are standing too near to the subject. Probably this is the case, and if yes, the problem of focus got the solution. Make sure to stand at least three inches apart from the subject. This is because the camera of iPhone is designed in a way that it can’t give you clear picture if it is placed too close to the subject. All in all, if you are holding your iPhone excessively close to the subject, pull it back little inches otherwise you will end up clicking a blurred photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/close.jpg"                      alt="stand too close"                ></p><h2 id="Part4-Upgrade-iOS"><a href="#Part4-Upgrade-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Part4: Upgrade iOS"></a>Part4: Upgrade iOS</h2><p> If you are still experiencing out of focus photography after giving try on the above solutions, the problem may have been occur due to the software. When iOS issues bother you and creating such problems, getting the latest iOS update typically solves the issues by removing any bugs and advancing the performance. Hence, it is recommended to update your iOS into the latest version when you are stuck with this iPhone focus issue. To execute this method, just head on to “Settings” &gt; “General” &gt; “Software Update” and look for the updates. You will be able to observe if there is any new update available. If yes, tap on “Install Now”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/upgrade-ios.jpg"                      alt="upgrade ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part5-Turn-off-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part5-Turn-off-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part5: Turn off your iPhone"></a>Part5: Turn off your iPhone</h2><p> If still the problem persists after using all the fixes, you can try turning off your device as a last resort. This will probably solve your problem and has worked in many cases. If in case it doesn’t work either, the last suggestion we could give you is, stepping towards the nearest Apple support center and consulting there. As they say that the work suits in the hands of the one who is skilled to do it. So, an expert at the iPhone customer service will surely understand the problem and will fix your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/turn-off-iphone-ios.jpg"                      alt="turn off iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p> When owning an electronic gadget, many unpredictable issues can occur and you get stuck with any of those without getting any notice.

The situation can be more frustrating when you are fond of photography. We provided some easy to perform solutions above and hope they were useful to you. However, if unfortunately nothing worked and you are still there, we would suggest you to replace your device to the new one.</p><p> Images come from the Internet</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123728/7443" target="_top" id="2123728">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123728" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123728/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-boosting-channel-earnings-the-step-by-step-famebit-guide-to-affiliates/"><u>[New] In 2024, Boosting Channel Earnings The Step-by-Step FameBit Guide to Affiliates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-expert-techniques-for-high-quality-android-recordings/"><u>[Updated] Expert Techniques for High-Quality Android Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-astrological-flair-in-digital-self-portrayals-on-whatsapp/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Astrological Flair in Digital Self-Portrayals on WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beyond-reality-horizon-virtual-progress-and-upcoming-challenges/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Beyond Reality Horizon Virtual Progress & Upcoming Challenges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-newcomers-elite-entryway-list-for-zooids-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Newcomers’ Elite Entryway List for Zooids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-pioneers-guide-to-vr-terminology/"><u>[Updated] The Pioneer's Guide to VR Terminology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/edit-images-seamlessly-with-lightzone-cross-platform-software-for-everyone/"><u>Edit Images Seamlessly with Lightzone - Cross-Platform Software for Everyone!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/navigating-asana-setbacks-a-guide-for-windows-users/"><u>Navigating Asana Setbacks: A Guide for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-premier-10-audio-reversal-tools-for-personal-computers-and-mobile-devices/"><u>New Unveiling the Premier 10 Audio Reversal Tools for Personal Computers & Mobile Devices</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

That is not available under this software at this point.</p><p>It would help if you used an online tool for GIF to APNG conversion, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.aconvert.com/image/gif-to-apng/" >AConvert.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step1 Open the online tool on your browser, and click on <strong>File</strong> to choose the source location type.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-7.jpg"                      alt="click on files"                ></p><p>Step2 Tap the “<strong>Choose File</strong>” option and add the main GIF you want to convert from your device&#x2F;cloud.

In this case, ensure the <strong>gif to sticker WhatsApp</strong> aspect ratio settings are set to 512 x 512 pixels since that is what the app supports. However, this would help create some standard-level stickers mainly.</p><p>Step1 Open your WhatsApp application on the phone and access the chat of the person you would send it to.</p><p>Step2 Click on the paperclip or media icon and insert the video on your device through that section. Alternatively, you can click on the camera to directly record a video using the slider icon above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-9.jpg"                      alt="click on paperclip or media"                ></p><p>Keep the video around 6 seconds long.

For sharing on Telegram, you have to use the same process through UniConverter’s Image Converter to change the images into 512 x 512-pixel dimensions. Then, add the pack in Telegram as a new sticker pack.</p><p>Step1 Access the Telegram app through the PC and open the chatbot function for Sticker through Search. The ID here is @Stickers.</p><p>Step2 Open the chat, type &#x2F;newpack.Press the Enter button. Again, give a name to the sticker pack and click on Enter.</p><p>Step3 Click on the File icon and add the GIF file from your device.</p><p>Step4 Assign a relatable emoji with the File and press Enter. Do the same for all files.</p><p>Step5 Add all stickers and type &#x2F;publish. Then, tap the Enter button.</p><p>Step6 Set the sticker pack’s unique URL name and share the stickers inside individually or altogether.</p><h2 id="How-to-custom-GIF-stickers-with-a-video-editor"><a href="#How-to-custom-GIF-stickers-with-a-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="How to custom GIF stickers with a video editor?"></a>How to custom GIF stickers with a video editor?</h2><p>While you can use the steps mentioned to turn GIFs into Telegram-based stickers, having a universal tool to make high-quality GIFs first would help.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is useful for creating interesting video files.

Just a single uncontrollable blast of that windy shake can immediately cause a big disturbance in your video footage. If you are a drone lover and often use to record videos in air then it is good to buy Gimbals for your device. They can stabilize your camera during all sudden and planned movements without affecting your image quality.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 must-have drone accessories &amp; parts &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> A gimbal is specially designed mechanism with rings; it pivots on right angles same as a chronometer or compass so that your attached device can stay perfectly aligned in horizontal direction even when aircraft is moving at high speed. Considering all sudden flight movements, the gimbal action is always safe and will keep things well aligned.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to remove jello effect from aerial video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Types-of-Gimbal"><a href="#Types-of-Gimbal" class="headerlink" title="Types of Gimbal"></a>Types of Gimbal</h2><p> When you are about to invest on a new gimbal then it is necessary to go through several aspects for right selection. Firstly, the type of motor your gimbal is going to use is extremely important. The drone camera gimbals are usually available in different models and each one of these has unique features. So, if you are thinking to buy a new one then go into following details:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type of Gimbal</th><th>Axis</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Servo Gimbal</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Light in weight and available with low price range</td><td>Their response time is a big issue</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Users need not to spend on additional controller board to operate it.</td><td>Most of users stay unsatisfied with its quality.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brushless Gimbal</td><td>2 axis</td><td>Low price and Light weight</td><td>2 axis gimbals are able to stabilize only on roll and pitch axis</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>You will have to compromise for quality</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Its horizontal movements are found quite jittery</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3 axis</td><td>Due to presence of yaw it leads to higher stability, quality, pitch as well as roll to stabilize.</td><td>You will find it much heavier; it can affect your flight time.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>There are two radio transmitters: one can control camera and other works for pilot</td><td>You need to spend more.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones"></a>What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones</h2><h4 id="1-Price"><a href="#1-Price" class="headerlink" title="1. Price"></a>1. Price</h4><p> If you have fewer budgets then you need to plan more wisely for selection of gimbal. Most of the users prefer to buy servo gimbals in such situations as they are least expensive. Although, you may find little disturbance in your video footage but it can definitely meet your basic need for first person view. In case if you have enough savings then professionals suggest to go for brushless gimbals.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Time"><a href="#2-Flight-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. Flight Time"></a>2. Flight Time</h4><p> Gimbals are going to add some weight to your drone hence they have direct impact on your flight time. Heavy gimbal means lesser flight time so you need to choose accordingly. A 2 axis type gimbal will force you to compromise for quality but it will allow your device to stay in air for longer duration. On the other side, 3 axis gimbals will provide you videos without any unwanted noise but yes they will reduce flight time.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Dones with Longest Flight Time for 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Picture-Quality"><a href="#3-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3. Picture Quality"></a>3. Picture Quality</h4><p> Here is the most important factor that you need to consider while purchasing your new gimbal. If you are more focused about quality and clarity in footage then brushless gimbals are best option for you. But note that, it poses restriction on many other factors like price and the power consumption.</p><h4 id="4-Camera-Support"><a href="#4-Camera-Support" class="headerlink" title="4. Camera Support"></a>4. Camera Support</h4><p> Gimbals are developed with classic mechanism and they are able to work with dedicated camera units. You can also find gimbals that can handle multiple camera types. During your selection, prefer to pick a gimbal that can support GoPro cameras because they are most commonly used ones. GoPro cameras are highly recommended for aerial videography and photography so if you are also working in the same direction then prefer to choose your design accordingly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Drones for GoPro in 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pre-Calibration"><a href="#5-Pre-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="5. Pre-Calibration"></a>5. Pre-Calibration</h4><p> Gimbal calibration can be little complication job, especially if you are a beginner. The best option is to buy a gimbal that comes with pre-calibration and users simply need to plugin them and send their drone into air to get best results. If your gimbal demands calibration from your side then it is necessary to follow professional guidelines before sending your drone into air.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Once you have selected your gimbal then you may find some difficulty in installation process.

Whether a professional or someone looking for a personal adventure video shooting device, GoPro has eased the job for everybody. Off late, Nikon the premier camera-manufacturing brand has introduced a series of Keymission action camera models. Recently, after the release of Keymission 170 (widely in glance for the 170 degree view), with features comparable to the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong>, there is much hype among the buyers when making a choice.

GoPro Comparison"></a>Comparative Analysis- Nikon Vs. GoPro Comparison</h4><h4 id="Design-Interface"><a href="#Design-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Design&amp; Interface"></a>Design&amp; Interface</h4><ol><li><strong>Weight &amp; Size</strong><br>The difference of 10g weight is not a big issue while the Nikon camera has larger dimensions. The small GoPro has a cute compact design having an appeal in itself.</li><li><strong>Screen Display</strong><br>Both these cameras have LCD display screen. You can control the menus, live streaming and other functions on the screen. With larger screen space and touch operation, GoPro is easy to handle. Comparing the screen, you will find better resolution, clarity and brighter display on GoPro.</li><li><strong>Interface</strong><br>The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> features dual shutters- separate for video and still image capturing allowing lesser adjustments in the settings. Switching between the video and photo modes in GoPro is easy to do via voice commands or the menu.</li></ol><h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><ol><li><strong>Photo Quality</strong><br>There is a notable difference in the performance of GoPro and Nikon when it comes to taking still images. With 12MP resolution (4000X3000 pixel settings) Hero 5 stands much ahead of Keymission 170 giving you the joy of capturing still photos at the resolution of 8.3MP (3840x2160 pixels). Another important convenience with GoPro is that you can take geo tagged photos besides the choice of shooting WDR and RAW photos. Nikon does not feature GPS configuration. You also cannot take RAW photos with Keymission 170.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-test1.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 test"                ></li><li><strong>Video Quality</strong><br>The video quality output of these cameras is the real point of attraction for all buyers. To all your relaxation, both of them can capture 4K30 (highest resolution) videos. Luckily, the quality of the videos is almost the same.Using the Protune settings on GoPro, you can get better results with sharpening, change ISO limits, take RAW videos with preferred audio settings, adjust the white balance etc. The first time users can use the default settings to capture good high-resolution videos. Keymission allows some limited adjustments with the Pro settings. You can obtain improved video quality by changing the white balance, exposure compensation and other details.<br><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmstocks.com/effects-store-upgrade.html" >Get Cool After Effects for Your Video&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br>Video Modes<br>When it comes to considering the availability of the video modes, the GoPro Hero 5 Black is the ultimate winner. You can get a range of video modes on this camera with varied pixels and fps combinations. The Keymission offers fewer choices to set the video capturing modes.<br>The GoPro works fine for the professionals looking to capture industry standard videos at 4K resolution.At normal speed, you can choose to set video modes at maximum of 2160p shooting at 30 or 25 fps. You can adjust the frame rate from 25 fps to 60fps while shooting at 1080 pixel resolution. These adjustments are sufficient if you are a beginner and want to get handy with action cameras.<br>Field of View (FOV)<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-black-keymission170-fov.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 fov"                ><br>As the name suggests, the Keymission 170 only offers the standard view of 170 degrees only. The degree is reduced a bit less when you are using the image stabilization feature. With flexible frame rate adjustments and resolution, you can use several FOV options including superview, wide, linear, medium, narrow etc. with GoPro Hero 5 Balck.<br>Stabilization<br>The video stabilization in Nikon Keymission 170 action camera is more advanced especially when you are using the external Gyrostabilizer.<br>White Balance<br>Nikon Keymission gives you an amazing feel with the yellowish orange effect when using the default white balance. This is much enhanced compared to that on the GoPro Hero 5 black. GoPro supports automatic white balance adjustment according to the ambiance and lights. While this feature is very advanced in the latest, model but not as that of the Nikon effect.<br>Low Light Video Capturing<br>There are shortcomings with both these cameras when you are shooting under low light availability. Yet, GoPro is a bit advanced to give you good video quality under low light. With Nikon it is preferable to use extra lights if you desire to get bright sharp objects.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-low-light-test.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 low light test"                ></li><li><strong>Audio Quality</strong><br>The Hero 5 Black is very tactically designed with dual microphones – at the rear and front ends. The camera can auto switch microphone during video capturing based on the requirements. To give you better sound quality, the camera swaps to the back microphone during heavy disturbing noise coming from the front direction like biking under heavy wind speed. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> has built in stereo microphone to produce medium quality satisfactory sound capturing.</li></ol><h4 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h4><ol><li><strong>Waterproof&#x2F; Dust-Proof&#x2F;Freeze-Proof&#x2F;Shockproof</strong><br>Both of these are waterproof cameras and safe to use underwater at a depth of 10m. If you are going beyond 10m, the GoPro housing gives you the convenience to travel up to 60m deep while Nikon housing gives protection at depths up to 40m only.<br>As far as the other protection features are concerned, GoPro lacks dust resistance, freezer sustenance and shockproof protection. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> with 2m shockproof protection can sustain knocks, shakes, jerks and bumps to some extent. Perfect for freezing points up to -10C&#x2F;14F, the camera is your best friend while skiing, snowboarding, snorkeling and going underwater in cold weather.</li><li><strong>Battery &amp; Memory</strong><br>Both these cameras function on lithium ion batteries (provided with the camera). <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong> offers improved battery version allowing you to shoot 4k @ 24 fps videos for 2 hours. With the same settings, the Nikon battery will last for an hour of shooting.<br>On the memory card storage, Nikon rules indispensably. The double storage capacity of 128GB, the device works perfect while shooting 4K videos. You can store the entire stuff for over days of shooting. Even with the 64GB storage, GoPro can give you convenient space to store large standard video projects. However, you can change cards and later merge them during editing</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi &amp; App</strong><br>Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth<br>Both these cameras allow connectivity via Bluetooth and Wifi. The Wifi functions superbly to support live video streaming, photo capturing with apps etc.<br>App<br>Both Hero 5 Black and Keymission 170 allow app access on Android and iOS platforms. The Nikon’s SnapBridge app poses bug issues blocking seamless operation. As compared to this, the GoPro has a series of mobile apps you can use as per requirement. Apps like Capture, Quik and others make your camera operation easy. However, some of them may have error problems. It is better to choose in context to user ratings.</li></ol><h4 id="GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera"><a href="#GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera"></a>GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera</h4><p>As with the pricing, both these cameras are available at almost the same range. As far as the Nikon vs. GoPro comparison on technological specifications are concerned, it is obvious that the Keymission 170 is a bit lacking in advancement. The model is somewhat near to the earlier GoPro Hero Session model priced at $199. With the same perfection and some extra detailing, Nikon at $399.99 is not worth any match for the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black.</strong></p><h4 id="Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users"><a href="#Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users" class="headerlink" title="Recommend best video editing software for action camera users"></a><strong>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</strong></h4><p>If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.

All the associated properties have X and Y axis only. However, if you are planning to create 3D text and title, you need to have Z axis.</p><p>After Effects has “Enable per-character 3D” property to all Z axis to applicable properties so that you can get the desired effect. You can go to properties like rotation or position to find Z axis that you can modify and get the perfect 3D text.</p><h3 id="2-Rotation-and-Anchor-Point"><a href="#2-Rotation-and-Anchor-Point" class="headerlink" title="2.

There are unlimited variations of text animations and effects that you can create using rotation parameter in After Effects. The rotation takes place in proportion to the anchor points of the text. When you change the value of Rotation parameter, the actual rotation takes place around the anchor points.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080347/19272" target="_top" id="2080347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080347/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Scale-and-Position"><a href="#3-Scale-and-Position" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can use keyframes and for each keyframe, you can adjust the scale value and create an illustration of zooming in and out very easily.</p><p>There are different variations of zoom in and out effect that you can try on your text and title to make animation creative and visually appealing. On the other hand, position refers to the location of the text on the video frame depending on X, Y, and Z axis values.</p><h3 id="4-Blur-and-Opacity"><a href="#4-Blur-and-Opacity" class="headerlink" title="4.

Fill and Stroke"></a>5. Fill and Stroke</h3><p>When it comes to text formatting in animation, fill color and stroke color play a major role. You can change the fill of the text so that the text animation is about changing color randomly. There are different options available for fill color such as RGB, Hue, Saturation, and likewise.</p><p>Similarly, the stroke color can be changed and you can create an animation with changing outline color. At the same time, you can adjust the stroke width to make the text look thick or thin as per your animation requirements.</p><h3 id="6-Skew"><a href="#6-Skew" class="headerlink" title="6.

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>app on your PC.

What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe-1"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps-1"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>app on your PC.
