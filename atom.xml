People like me who work as freelancers or in different companies now use Zoom for numerous work calls and daily virtual meets.

You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it.

YouTube: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis"></a>Twitch Vs. YouTube: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis</h2><p>In recent years, the popularity of streaming content has exploded. This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming"></a>Part 2. Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming</h2><h3 id="YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership"><a href="#YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership"></a>YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership</h3><p>Affiliate programs are accessible on both Twitch and YouTube with specific requirements that you need to adhere to. These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content. Although creating your followers’ community at first can be difficult, it largely depends on how engaging and compelling your content is.</p><p>As a new content creator or a streamer to create and upload pre-recorded videos, YouTube is a better choice for you. Make sure to upload the most enthralling games to keep your audience captivating and interested.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More"><a href="#Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?"></a>Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?</h2><p>The amount of revenue you can make on Twitch or YouTube is directly related to your follower base. The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options. However, it is difficult to grow on Twitch compared to YouTube, which has a stronger user base.</p><p>YouTube is easier to generate income in the long run as you can upload recorded gaming videos which can get more viewers as it is always available on the platform. Moreover, you can also make more from YouTube ads than on Twitch.</p><p><strong>Video - Where Should You Stream in 2022? - Twitch vs YouTube Live</strong></p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?"></a>How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?</h3><p>On YouTube, a streamer mainly gets paid based on the ads, which is $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="15-Ways-to-Make-Most-of-Your-Podcast-Time"><a href="#15-Ways-to-Make-Most-of-Your-Podcast-Time" class="headerlink" title="15 Ways to Make Most of Your Podcast Time"></a>15 Ways to Make Most of Your Podcast Time</h2><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining. If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15.

However, the device is not waterproof itself so you need to add protective housing to take it under water. Manufacturers have designed this camera with impressive style where controls are made much easier with added 2.2 inch retina touch screen. On the front side of this device, you will find ultra wide lens that offer fish eye look to make your recordings more efficient.

However, you can also use your camera to shoot instant photos.</p><p><strong>Color correction:</strong> your image color could be too bright or dull. This feature enables you to correct the color to a perfect tone. Besides, you get to choose from a wide range of colors, or better still, do a quick mix even as you correct the needed sections.</p><p>You don’t intend to compose your video and miss an open platform to share your content.

It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting.

These include contrast, temperature, pivot, saturation, and dynamic range. Use the “Compare” button to compare the changes with the original file. The “before” and the “after” image should give you a deeper insight into what your video is like after adjustment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/everything-about-3d-lut-creator-4.jpg"                      alt="features of 3d luts - adjust the image"                ></p><h3 id="5-Find-the-custom-LUT-adjustment-3"><a href="#5-Find-the-custom-LUT-adjustment-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Adjust the colors</h3><p>For this feature, use the spider’s web in the A&#x2F;B Grid and use the “color wheel.” Several points on the web represent the colors in your image.

You will have changed the original color within the image to another color.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/everything-about-3d-lut-creator-5.jpg"                      alt="features of 3d luts - adjust the color"                ></p><h3 id="7-Generate-a-LUT-File-3"><a href="#7-Generate-a-LUT-File-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Generate a LUT File"></a>7. Generate a LUT File</h3><p>You can choose to save the adjustments as a LUT file. To create such a file, go to the “File” menu and select the “File” tab, then click on the “Export” option. Next, name your file and choose the LUT format that you want to use. The most popular LUT format is “cube”. More so, it is quite compatible with several photo editors. Likewise, you can export your content to other platforms.</p><h2 id="Does-3D-LUT-have-a-mobile-app-3"><a href="#Does-3D-LUT-have-a-mobile-app-3" class="headerlink" title="Does 3D LUT have a mobile app?"></a>Does 3D LUT have a mobile app?</h2><p>Yes. 3D LUT has a mobile app version. You can use it to adjust your videos and photos from the comfort of your palms. It comprises these features.</p><p><strong>Basic color adjustment:</strong> This feature allows you to change your video or image color to your satisfaction. You can make it brighter or dull by moving the brightness bar to either the left or the right. Other adjustments are the contrast, saturation, and white balance.</p><p><strong>Choose your photos from the gallery:</strong> you don’t have to search for your data from other platforms. Simply choose photos or videos to use from the gallery. This applies to the earlier saved photos. However, you can also use your camera to shoot instant photos.</p><p><strong>Color correction:</strong> your image color could be too bright or dull. This feature enables you to correct the color to a perfect tone. Besides, you get to choose from a wide range of colors, or better still, do a quick mix even as you correct the needed sections.</p><p>You don’t intend to compose your video and miss an open platform to share your content. Use the export tab to instantly share your video or images once ed to perfection. You can use it for marketing or tutorials.</p><h3 id="The-3D-LUT-desktop-version-3"><a href="#The-3D-LUT-desktop-version-3" class="headerlink" title="The 3D LUT desktop version"></a>The 3D LUT desktop version</h3><p>The desktop version is the most widely used. It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works-3"><a href="#How-it-works-3" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks-3"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks-3" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting. It gives a different approach to several common photo editors on the market. You get the 3D LUT mobile app version and the desktop version. It also brings you tons of tools to pull through any piece of colorwork on your images and videos. However, working with this program is complex and may suit only professional photographers and editors.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-satirists-web-workshop/"><u>[New] Satirist's Web Workshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-visionary-chip-uninterrupted-editing-on-the-newest-tech-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Visionary Chip  Uninterrupted Editing on the Newest Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-chuckle-friendly-image-editors-for-all-devices/"><u>[New] Chuckle-Friendly Image Editors for All Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/securing-photo-libraries-without-copyright-notices-for-2024/"><u>Securing Photo Libraries Without Copyright Notices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-gopro-hero5-black-vs-yi-4k-action-camera-which-is-better/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, GoPro Hero5 Black Vs.

Now, by integrating Artificial Intelligent features, we can use any online photo background changer to instantly remove the existing background of our images (or replace it with a new one). From all the available options, I have listed some of the most perfect photo background changer tools that you can readily use.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</h2><p>Ideally, you can consider using an image background changer due to either of the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While clicking an image, there could be unwanted objects or too many people in the background.</li><li>You might have to completely remove the background of an image and use it for any other purpose.</li><li>Chances are that you might want to use your photo for a professional task, and its background could not be so appealing.</li><li>There could be any other creative reason for you to remove the background of a photo and apply any other layer instead.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers"></a>Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</h2><p>If you are looking for a reliable online photo background changer tool, then you can consider exploring the following solutions:</p><h4 id="2-Remove-BG"><a href="#2-Remove-BG" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove BG"></a>2. Remove BG</h4><p>Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Spark"></a>3. Adobe Spark</h4><p>If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4. Wondershare PixCut"></a>4. Wondershare PixCut</h4><p>Developed by Wondershare, PixCut is a free online background changer tool that you can use on any browser. To use it, you just have to go to its official website and simply upload any photo. Now, the online tool would automatically remove the background of your photo with its smart AI features. Later, PixCut will let you save the file in the PNG format that you can edit on any application on your system or mobile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-pixcut.jpg"                      alt="wondershare pixcut"                ></p><h4 id="5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover"></a>5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Slazzer has come up with a wide range of utility tools, including an online photo background changer. The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6. Fotor Photo Background Changer"></a>6. Fotor Photo Background Changer</h4><p>Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover"></a>7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-clip-magic.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer clip magic"                ></p><h4 id="8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover"><a href="#8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover"></a>8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover</h4><p>As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9. Foco Clipping"></a>9. Foco Clipping</h4><p>The next perfect photo background changer that I would recommend is from Foco Clipping. One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-foco.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer foco"                ></p><h4 id="10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer"><a href="#10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="10.PicsArt Image Background Changer"></a>10.PicsArt Image Background Changer</h4><p>The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features. You can upload your photos one by one and can manually edit them on its interface. The application can automatically remove the background of your image and would let you save it as a PNG file on your system (to be used offline with any other application).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-picsart.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer picsart"                ></p><h4 id="11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="11.

Most of the headsets have the ability to track the user’s head movements so that the wherever the user looks, the character in the virtual reality also looks. If done in the right manner, the headsets give an impression of the user being actually inside the game or the movie, hence the name “virtual reality”.</p><h2 id="How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work"><a href="#How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Virtual Reality headsets work"></a>How does Virtual Reality headsets work</h2><p> The principle goal of the virtual reality headsets is to create life-size, 3D virtual environments with no boundaries like those associated with computer or television screens. In case of the Rift or HTC’s Vive, video is sent from the computer or the console to the headset through a HDMI cable, while for the Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, the videos are already on the smartphone mounted on the headsets.</p><p> The VR headsets may use a single feed or two feeds sent directly to either one or two LCD displays, one for each eye. There are also a set of lenses placed between the user’s eyes and the pixels and this is the reason why the devices are sometimes referred to as goggles. In some cases, the lenses can be adjusted to match the distance between the eyes and this distance will also vary from one user to another.</p><p> The lenses will focus and reshape the images for each eye before creating a stereoscopic 3D image by positioning the 2D images to portray how each of the two eyes see the world. One way in which the virtual reality headsets increases immersion is by increasing the field of view or simply how wide a picture appears. A 360 degrees display may not be convenient and most of the high end VR headsets usually use 100 or 110 degree field of views, which is usually sufficient enough to give the effects.</p><p> And for the final images to be totally convincing, the VR headsets use minimum frame rates of 60fps to do away with shuttering or make the users feel sick.</p><h2 id="Top-VR-headsets-overview"><a href="#Top-VR-headsets-overview" class="headerlink" title="Top VR headsets overview"></a>Top VR headsets overview</h2><p> The race by tech giants to get their share of the virtual reality market is on and company after company is burning the midnight oil to produce the next best headset.</p><p> Below is a list of the various VR headsets currently available to purchase:</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.vive.com/" >HTC Vive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-vive.png"                      alt="ghtc-vive-vr"                ></p><p> HTC Vive VR headset is made in collaboration with Valve and it plugs directly into PCs and uses Valve’s humongous gaming ecosystem. The headset has over 70 sensors to allow for 360 degrees head tracking and it also boasts of a 90Hz refresh rate responsible for keeping down the latency, which in turn saves the users from suffering motions sickness. This headset is currently available for purchase from $799.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" >Samsung Gear VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gear-vr.png"                      alt="gear-vr"                ></p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is essentially Oculus Rift lite, owing to the fact that the two companies worked on the technology together. The Gear VR uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone for the display and as the processor. The phone slots in front of the lenses and into a Micro USB slot, and uses the super AMOLED display as the screen. With the Gear, all you have to do is to slot in the phone, put on the headset and start enjoying the virtual reality experience.</p><h3 id="Oculus-Rift"><a href="#Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Rift"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/" >Oculus Rift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oculus-rift.jpg"                      alt="oculus-rift"                ></p><p> Oculus Rift headset was responsible for the current hysteria in virtual reality. The Rift plugs into the computer’s USB and DVI ports and tracks the movements of the head to provide 3D displays on its stereo screens. The consumer edition of the Rift comes with a 2160 x 1200 resolution as well as a refresh rate of 90Hz. The Rift matches HTC Vive in terms of the refresh rate, but lags behind Sony’s PlayStation VR, though it is a pretty advanced VR headset in terms of the technology used.</p><h3 id="Sony-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Sony-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Sony PlayStation VR"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/" >Sony PlayStation VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-playstation-vr.jpg"                      alt="sony-playstation-vr"                ></p><p> Sony has finally announced the launch date for the PlayStation VR headset and this is expected to be 13th October 2016. A new version though, was announced way back in 2015 and it featured a 5-inch LCD display of the original prototype. For the version to be released, it is expected to have a 5.7 inch OLED to allow for low persistence which will in turn translate to less motion blur. The refresh rate for Sony’s PlayStation VR has been ramped up to 120Hz, making it possible to have 120fps gaming.</p><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a><a class="link"   href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-cardboard-vr.jpg"                      alt="google-cardboard-vr"                ></p><p> Not to be left behind, Google also has a cardboard virtual reality headset. With this headset, it sounds like popping your smartphone in a cardboard container and putting it over your head for a virtual reality experience. Sounds like a joke, but you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it works like charm and it is also low cost. If anything, the smartphone you have already has all the gyroscopic sensors as well as the positioning devices needed to track your head movements.</p><p> Since the Cardboard has grown so much in terms of popularity, Google has planned to release a better version known as Daydream. This will be a device like the Gear VR, but it has been designed to work with android phones which are currently being revamped to over better VR experiences. It is still not know when the new device will be available, but the Cardboard is retailing at $16.99 at Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/navigating-the-lunapic-interface-like-a-pro-for-2024/"><u>Navigating the LunaPic Interface Like a Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhance-audio-visual-experience-windows-media-player-subtitles/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhance Audio-Visual Experience  Windows Media Player Subtitles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-quick-guide-eliminating-photo-viewer-crashes-on-windows-10/"><u>[Updated] Quick Guide  Eliminating Photo Viewer Crashes on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-plan-to-grow-your-subscriber-base/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Plan to Grow Your Subscriber Base</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tuning-into-audio-bliss-your-iphone-as-a-podcasters-companion/"><u>2024 Approved  Tuning Into Audio Bliss - Your iPhone as a Podcaster's Companion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-metaverse-comedy-crafting-memetic-gold/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Metaverse Comedy  Crafting Memetic Gold</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-bebops-visionary-feathered-future-examined-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Bebop's Visionary Feathered Future Examined for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-special-features-virtual-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Use Special Features - Virtual Location On Apple iPhone 13 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-revealed-the-5-superior-mac-compatible-audio-mixers/"><u>New In 2024, Revealed The 5 Superior Mac-Compatible Audio Mixers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-mac-for-apple-iphone-6s-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on Mac For Apple iPhone 6s?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-dragon-scale-and-evolution-enabled-pokemon-on-oppo-find-n3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Oppo Find N3? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/navigating-lawful-practices-for-screenshotting-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Lawful Practices for Screenshotting YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhance-post-strategy-with-these-top-8-ios-and-android-planners/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhance Post Strategy with These Top 8 iOS & Android Planners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-user-testimonials-and-reviews-on-the-lg-bp350-monitor/"><u>2024 Approved  User Testimonials and Reviews on the LG BP350 Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-strategies-for-transforming-podcast-audio-into-mp3-format/"><u>Updated In 2024, Top Strategies for Transforming Podcast Audio Into MP3 Format</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.</p><p><strong>(1) Simple to use</strong></p><p>The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the “Edit” button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the “Subtitle” tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.</p><p>Most <strong>Sub to SRT converter online</strong> requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>(2) Using experience</strong></p><p>The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.</p><p><strong>(3) Format supported</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video formats:</strong> AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.</li><li><strong>Subtitle formats:</strong> SRT, ASS, SSA</li></ul><p>While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what’s happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.</p><p>So, when you are using a <strong>TXT to SRT converter online</strong>, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles. For that, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, EditingTools.io, Rev, and VEED, are some of the best options to trust with various beneficial qualities.

However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.</p><p><strong>(1) Simple to use</strong></p><p>The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the “Edit” button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the “Subtitle” tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.</p><p>Most <strong>Sub to SRT converter online</strong> requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>(2) Using experience</strong></p><p>The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.</p><p><strong>(3) Format supported</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video formats:</strong> AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.</li><li><strong>Subtitle formats:</strong> SRT, ASS, SSA</li></ul><p>While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what’s happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.</p><p>So, when you are using a <strong>TXT to SRT converter online</strong>, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles.
