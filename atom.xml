For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons" class="headerlink" title="2.

It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date. Alternatively, you can find public domain content by visiting the Public Domain group URL.</p><h2 id="Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine"><a href="#Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine"></a>Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</h2><p>Although Google search is the most popular resource for royalty-free art, there are specific public domain art search engines to help you find exactly what you need. Here are a few of them to consider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115950/19272" target="_top" id="2115950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115950/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Artvee-com"><a href="#1-Artvee-com" class="headerlink" title="1.

The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo"><a href="#2-Museo" class="headerlink" title="2.

Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes. Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it.

Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date.

Here are a few of them to consider.</p><h3 id="1-Artvee-com-1"><a href="#1-Artvee-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Artvee.com"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://artvee.com/" >Artvee.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-5.jpg"                      alt="artvee com"                ></p><p>Artvee.com is a public domain art search engine that specializes in classical art. The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo-1"><a href="#2-Museo-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Museo"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://museo.app/" >Museo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-6.jpg"                      alt="museo"                ></p><p>Another public domain art search engine to consider is Museo.app. It is an open-source web interface that allows you to find royalty-free art from different museums. Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ-1"><a href="#FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes.

The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods to use b roll"></a>2. Methods to use b roll</h2><p>Now that there are so many stock footage platforms, you have a lot of choices when you need just the right scene for your project. Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.

Archival b roll footage</h3><p>Aerial B roll is the solution when you like to show your viewers where your film is being recorded or when you are changing locations and want them to know it. The plane takes off and lands in another city, and then shots of the city, its landmarks, its famous streets, etc. are shown. You have probably seen this type of B roll footage in movies and TV shows. These images aid in putting the viewer in the character’s current location.

These add to the story the video creator wants to talk about not seeing people with a disability differently.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115947/19272" target="_top" id="2115947">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115947" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115947/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Undirected-b-roll-footage"><a href="#4-Undirected-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is especially useful when you are discussing a narrative that has been experienced in the past or that has futuristic relevance.</p><p>Have a look at the scenes from the episode “14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible” that can be found on Netflix. As a result of the use of archive film footage of b roll from the relevant time period in its production, the audience is able to connect with the narrative on a deeper level.</p><h3 id="6-Pick-up-shots"><a href="#6-Pick-up-shots" class="headerlink" title="6.

Both types of shots are commonly added during film editing to fix, logic, continuity, or quality flaws. These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014859/22899" target="_top" id="2014859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014859/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7.

The video’s most crucial segments were filmed with primary footage.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that this post will be of use to you in making your films more cinematic. You not only know how to film and edit your videos utilizing B rolls, you also have an extremely effective hack that allows you to generate amazing videos using stock footage.

According to the concept, put on those bulky goggles and transport yourself to a brand new world without going anywhere. People often compare this with the escapism achieved through drugs, alcohol and sex. But that is altogether a different context and let’s not get into that.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Virtual-Reality-Hardware-Market-Analysis"><a href="#The-Virtual-Reality-Hardware-Market-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="The Virtual Reality Hardware Market Analysis"></a>The Virtual Reality Hardware Market Analysis</h2><p> Right in this moment, there are basically three major players in the market. HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are considered as the best compared to Samsung. Samsung Gear VR is regarded for the middle class since it hasn’t yet been able to show the result that is expected.</p><p> On the other hand, the sales figure of HTC Vive is creating new highs with time. They have recently announced that their sales figure will soon reach the 100,000 mark. If we consider the market since its appearance, this is too young now and the sales figure of HTC is pretty impressive no doubt.</p><p> However, a recent rumor has ignited the sale of Oculus Rift. The buzz is that Facebook is backing this VR giant. Though, no confirmation has been made from both the sides. But users are not bothered about the confirmation.</p><p> If we look at the reasons behind the HTC’s grand success in the VR Gear world, it is the superior technology. HTC is more into offering a unique experience to the users with their 15’X15’ room scale experience.</p><p> The Oculus rift is expected to come up with some new features in the second half of 2016 with room scaling and gesture controller. This will help to sense the gestures through infrared dots. This technology can really take the VR Gear experience to a different level.</p><p> Apart from these brands, two other popular technology giants Microsoft and Sony is also coming up with technology that supports VR gaming. Recently Microsoft has unveiled their new iteration of Xbox One that is Xbox One S. It has upgraded platforms which are believed to support VR gaming. Sony has also made an announcement of a new iteration of PS4 which will support VR gaming and it will be released on 13th October this year.</p><p> The market experts believe that the participation of these technology giants in the VR gaming industry will increase the sales and take the market towards maturity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-market.jpg"                      alt=" vr-market"                ></p><h2 id="What-the-VR-hardware-market-will-be-in-future"><a href="#What-the-VR-hardware-market-will-be-in-future" class="headerlink" title="What the VR hardware market will be in future"></a>What the VR hardware market will be in future</h2><p> The prospect of the VR gaming market in the three years is expected to boom literally. More people will get to know about the technology and words of mouth and more promotion will bring in more enthusiasts. The number will hit the million marks as expected.</p><p> This is too early for a technological revolution to take place and there is nothing to be so frustrated at this early age. It needs time and with the increasing awareness the sales will boom. All the companies need to focus at the promotion of this new technology now. They should let the users know how their gaming experience is about to change. In the near future VR Gear is going to be the next big thing in technology.</p><h2 id="Brief-overview-of-VR-hardware"><a href="#Brief-overview-of-VR-hardware" class="headerlink" title="Brief overview of VR hardware"></a>Brief overview of VR hardware</h2><p> If the opinions of the experts are to be believed, we are still quite far from the mature virtual reality market. But there is no denying the fact that this early stage of technological revolution has created quite a buzz among the technology lovers.

Don’t panic, we got you covered with the step-by-step instructions to create a .srt subtitle file and such a computer.</p><p>The process of creating a .srt file for video on Mac is quite similar to .srt file creation on Windows. You don’t require the installation of a third-party program. However, on Mac, you’ll use TextEdit as Notepad is not supported.</p><p>Let’s proceed to the stepwise guide on how to make an SRT file by yourself for video on Mac without wasting time;</p><p>Step1 Turn on your Mac computer and start TextEdit.</p><p>Step2 Create a new file. But before writing any subtitle captions, play the video whose subtitle you want to write and listen to the first line of the audio.</p><p>After you’ve grabbed the first line, type 1 and write the first Timestamp in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</p><p>Here is an example of what you should do;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the times indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the screen.</p><p>Step3 Type your subtitle content in the next line. If it’s a long text, you need to break it down into multiple subtitles.</p><p>Step4 Repeat step 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>See what an SRT subtitle looks like below;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle on mac"                ></p><p>Step5 Review and edit the subtitle.</p><p>Step6 To complete the operation, click <strong>‘File’</strong> at the top bar and select <strong>Save</strong> from the drop-down. Then navigate to ‘<strong>Save As’</strong> and type your file name, and change the extension from .txt to .srt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-2.jpg"                      alt="click on file"                ></p><p>Make sure you Uncheck the ‘Hide Extension’ and ‘If no extension is provided’ checkboxes.

However, for many users, this is a significant concern.</p><p>After all, faster-paced songs are more engaging and high-energy, invoking feelings of fun and excitement in people. This is one of the reasons why the sped-up songs on videos posted on social media platforms like TikTok are so catchy and shareable.</p><p>If you want a fast-paced song version but not necessarily a pre-made remix with extra effects, manually speeding it up should help**.**</p><p>If that is a concern for you, worry not. This post will detail the best solutions and software to <strong>speed up music on Spotify</strong> using its rich library of songs, with steps. Let’s continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-1.jpg"                      alt="image of spotify app"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-I-How-to-Speed-Up-Songs-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-I-How-to-Speed-Up-Songs-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part I.

How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?</h2><p>Firstly, consider if the process of <strong>changing a song’s speed on Spotify</strong> is directly applicable to the platform. The answer to that is no. As of the time of this writing, Spotify or any of the well-known online audio streaming sites still need to offer the music playback speed adjustment feature. This applies to both web and mobile versions while streaming songs.</p><p>While there is no direct function for adjusting Spotify songs or even podcasts’ playback speed, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playback-speed-ac/cgbihpjbhpdfbdckcabcniojdhcgblhd" >Spotify Playback Speed Access <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Spotify Web Player. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows users the ability to <strong>speed up Spotify songs</strong>, mainly on the web app version.</p><p>However, this extension was last updated in October 2019.

The steps for each option are mentioned- follow them carefully to ensure the best results with the process.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-best-5-gif-to-video-converters-online-no-need-to-download/"><u>[New] Best 5 GIF to Video Converters Online [No Need to Download]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-from-creator-to-critic-evaluating-video-value-across-platforms-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Creator to Critic Evaluating Video Value Across Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-revamp-your-talk-with-cloud-top-5-online-voice-altering-services-for-chrome-os-for-2024/"><u>[New] Revamp Your Talk with Cloud Top 5 Online Voice Altering Services for Chrome OS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dive-deep-into-hdr-creation-the-ultimate-photoshop-playbook/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Dive Deep Into HDR Creation The Ultimate Photoshop Playbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-the-mechanics-of-obtaining-facebooks-badge-of-trust/"><u>[Updated] Decoding the Mechanics of Obtaining Facebook's Badge of Trust</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-transforming-viral-tiktok-sounds-into-personalized-calls/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Transforming Viral TikTok Sounds Into Personalized Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-infinix-gt-10-pro-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Infinix GT 10 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/datadeliverers-professional-view/"><u>DataDeliverers Professional View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/elevate-photoshoots-select-your-ideal-background-viewer/"><u>Elevate Photoshoots Select Your Ideal Background Viewer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/exploring-digital-realms-metaverse-versus-multiverse-compared/"><u>Exploring Digital Realms Metaverse Versus Multiverse Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhance-mobile-conversations-with-unique-whatsapp-alerts-for-ios-and-android/"><u>In 2024, Enhance Mobile Conversations with Unique WhatsApp Alerts for iOS & Android</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

To the convenience of many, especially those involved with VR, it now comes with an improved workflow for editing virtual reality videos. While you will be required to use your favorite tools to stitch videos together for a 360 degree view, Adobe Premier Pro allows for the importation of such videos with an equirectangular projection that makes it possible to edit them just as you would work with any other video file.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Stitch GoPro Clips into 360 Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Editing-360-degrees-videos-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Editing-360-degrees-videos-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Editing 360 degrees videos in Premiere Pro"></a>Editing 360 degrees videos in Premiere Pro</h2><p> Consider the following steps when editing 360 degree videos using Premiere Pro from Adobe-:</p><h4 id="1-Import-your-360-footage"><a href="#1-Import-your-360-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Import your 360 footage"></a>1. Import your 360 footage</h4><p> After starting the application, the first step towards editing your videos is to import your footages into the application. Premiere Pro allows you to import equirectanglular video footages, which are just like the normal footages. To import your footages into the application, double click on the project panel or simply click Command + I.</p><h4 id="2-Adjust-your-settings"><a href="#2-Adjust-your-settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust your settings"></a>2. Adjust your settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-editing-settings.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Settings"                ></p><p> Premiere Pro allows you to view any video by double clicking on the video in the project panel. Be default, the equirectanglular video clips will appear on the preview panel, but they will be distorted. To change how the videos appear on the preview panel, it is imperative to adjust the settings. This is done by clicking on the wrench icon located at the bottom right of window then navigating to VR Video&gt;Settings. This will pull up the menu to let you adjust the various settings you need to proceed with the editing.</p><h4 id="3-Set-the-Preview-Window-to-VR-Mode"><a href="#3-Set-the-Preview-Window-to-VR-Mode" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the Preview Window to VR Mode"></a>3. Set the Preview Window to VR Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-vr-mode.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Enable VR mode"                ></p><p> After you have established the right settings for your project, the next thing you need to do is to set the preview window into VR Mode. There are two ways to do this and they include-:</p><ul><li>Click the wrench icon and choose Video &gt; VR Mode or,</li><li>From the button menu, select the VR Mode button, which can also be found by selecting the “+ icon”</li></ul><p> To navigate around the preview window in the VR Mode, use the sliders along the edges of the frame or simply click and drag when you are inside the frame. You should be familiar with these settings and actions if you have had some experience with YouTube VR in the past.</p><h4 id="4-Edit-your-footage"><a href="#4-Edit-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit your footage"></a>4. Edit your footage</h4><p> After importing your footage and adjusting the settings as well as setting the preview window into VR Mode, you are now ready to begin the actual editing of the 360 degree video in Premier Pro. In as much as VR editing sounds like a new phenomenon in video creation, it shouldn’t be viewed any differently from working with a video footage in the timeline. As long as the video footage remains equirectangular, you will be able to trim, slice and add color to the footage just as you would do when working with the normal videos. However, don’t forget that transformational effects such as warp stabilizer will not be available for your 360 video.</p><h4 id="5-Exporting-the-VR-Footage"><a href="#5-Exporting-the-VR-Footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Exporting the VR Footage"></a>5. Exporting the VR Footage</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-vr-footage.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Export VR footage"                ></p><p> A while back, exporting VR footages to YouTube was possible only through third party applications. But now, such capabilities have been included in Adobe Premiere Pro and you can now apply all the Meta data directly inside the application. To export your edited footage, navigate to File&gt;Export&gt;Media or simply hit Command + M to pop up the export window. Select your desired codecs and navigate to the video tab and ensure that you have selected the VR Video Checkbox.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a

We are experiencing back to back changes in operating system both from Microsoft and from the newly launched Apple’s Mac. The latest OS version from Mac, MacOS Sierra is out now. Everyone is so curious to install this OS in their Macbook. There are loads of new features available in the new OS. But, there are many people who may not want to try this latest version as full time so early.</p><p>Though, this is the latest version but this doesn’t necessarily mean you will have the best experience with it all the time. So, if you have decided to downgrade to the older version that is OS X EI Capitan, we have the step by step solution for you. The steps are really simple to perform. So, here is how to downgrade from Mac OS Sierra to OS X EI Capitan.</p><p>Ok, so before we start, I just want to tell you one thing that either open this article on a different device or take a print out if you are right now reading this article on the very machine that you want to downgrade.</p><p>So, there are basically three steps of the whole process:</p><ul><li>Erase MacOS Sierra</li><li>Re-install OS X EI Capitan</li><li>Restore your data through time machine</li></ul><p>We will cover each step one by one so that it becomes easy to understand to all of you. And one more thing, you need to have an internet connection for this. So, here is the first step for you.</p><h3 id="Erase-MacOS-Sierra"><a href="#Erase-MacOS-Sierra" class="headerlink" title="Erase MacOS Sierra"></a>Erase MacOS Sierra</h3><p>1. First of all connect you Mac with a strong internet connection either through Wi-Fi or you can even use Ethernet connection. Make sure the connection is stable.</p><p>2. Now click on the “Apple” icon on your desktop.</p><p>3. You will see the dropdown menu there and you need to select “Restart” from the menu.</p><p>4. Now, do this step carefully. You need to hold down the Commanr+R together as soon as you hear the start up ding and keep holding till the time your computer reboots.</p><p>5. Now click on the “Disk Utility” button under the OS X Utilities section.</p><p>6. You will get the option to continue. Click on that.</p><p>7. Select your Startup Disk from the option.</p><p>8. At the top of the window you will see Earse tab. Click on that.</p><p>9. Now, enter the manes of the file you want to delete like MacOS Sierra.</p><p>10. Also select Mac OS Extended from the list and click Erase.</p><p>Once the process is completed quit the Disk Utility section from the dropdown, shown on the upper left corner of your screen. And go back to the OS X EI Capitan segment.</p><p>So, this is the end of the first step. Now we will move on to the next step that is reinstall OS X EI Capitan.</p><h3 id="Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan"><a href="#Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan" class="headerlink" title="Reinstall Os X EI Capitan"></a>Reinstall Os X EI Capitan</h3><p>Now that you have erased the present version of the OS from your Mac, you would like to install an older version for sure.</p><p>1.Go to the OS X Utilities selector and click on the “Reinstall OS X” from the dropdown.</p><p>2. Here you will see the EI Capitan installation window and click on “Continue”.</p><p>Here I would like to mention something. Depending on the date of purchase of your Mac, you may download an older version of Mac OS. You can even install the one that your Mac was shipped with. But for this you have to complete the process with Internet Recovery Mode. You can install older versions like Mavericks or Yosemite. When the installation is done open the Mac App Store. And here you will see OS X EI Capitan in your purchased list, download that. The OS will install like the standard upgrade. You have to agree with licensing terms for this.</p><p>So, we are only one step farther from the whole process to be completed. Here is the final step for you.</p><h3 id="Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine"><a href="#Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Restore your data from Time Machine"></a>Restore your data from Time Machine</h3><p>Like it is always recommended to backup your present data through Time Machine, if you have your data saved, you can use that to reinstall in the present OS that is OS X EI Capitan by following these simple steps:</p><p>1. First of all connect your Mac with internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p><p>2. Click on the “Apple” icon shown on the desktop.</p><p>3.

These videos show the benefits of a particular idea, product, or service with the help of concise text, infographics, appropriate narration, and images. In the business sphere, video presentations are used for everything – from marketing and increasing sales to B2B interactions and training employees.</p><p>Video presentations are used by businesses as a solution for video marketing on various channels, including email newsletters and social media.

Opt for Video presentations. Being much more appealing and interesting than regular cut-and-dry presentations, videos can deliver results. Some of the many benefits of using videos in your presentations are:</p><h4 id="1-Captures-People’s-Attention"><a href="#1-Captures-People’s-Attention" class="headerlink" title="1.  Captures People’s Attention"></a>1.  Captures People’s Attention</h4><p>Video presentations can grab the attention of the audience immediately. Videos offer you a delightful way to treat the audience, thus bringing your message to life in a way no other medium can. By incorporating interactive video presentation ideas, you can improve the viewer’s experience as well as utilize sound and sight to reel the audience in.</p><h4 id="2-Persuasive"><a href="#2-Persuasive" class="headerlink" title="2.  Persuasive"></a>2.  Persuasive</h4><p>Creating engaging video presentations can be a great way to persuade your target audience. Provoking emotional responses by incorporating audio-visual storytelling, adding sounds and sights into the mix, and bringing emotions can help you persuade your audience.</p><h4 id="3-Accessible-Anytime-Anywhere"><a href="#3-Accessible-Anytime-Anywhere" class="headerlink" title="3.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere"></a>3.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere</h4><p>People nowadays love spending time on their phones and tablets and so they prefer watching videos on them. This makes video presentations accessible anywhere, anytime. And with people becoming more reliant on technology at large, consider embracing videos to have a greater impact on viewers.</p><h4 id="4-Time-Efficient"><a href="#4-Time-Efficient" class="headerlink" title="4.  Time Efficient"></a>4.  Time Efficient</h4><p>Video presentations are specifically meant to allow the presenter to break down the information into smaller chunks. This way, viewers can digest larger amounts of information easily and quickly. Making video presentations can thus be a more time-effective decision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-time-efficient.jpg"                      alt="Video Presentation Time Efficient"                ></p><h2 id="12-Creative-Video-Presentation-Ideas-to-Wow-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Creative-Video-Presentation-Ideas-to-Wow-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience"></a>12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience</h2><h4 id="1-Start-With-A-Provocative-Statement"><a href="#1-Start-With-A-Provocative-Statement" class="headerlink" title="1.  Start With A Provocative Statement"></a>1.  Start With A Provocative Statement</h4><p>Making a provocative statement when presenting your video can grab the attention of your audience right from the get-go. When your statement offers something a little controversial or maybe a bit offensive and unexpected, it makes people sit up and take notice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-provocative-statement.jpg"                      alt="Video Presentation Provocative Statement"                ></p><p><em>“People don’t care about your brand.”</em> Reading this, anyone will be compelled to see how the presenter justifies his&#x2F;her point, isn’t it? The video begins with an unpredicted statement, explains why, and later shows what needs to be done for overcoming the hurdle.</p><h4 id="2-Narrate-a-Story"><a href="#2-Narrate-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  Narrate a Story"></a>2.  Narrate a Story</h4><p>One of the most interesting video presentation ideas to grab your audience’s attention is telling a story that evokes their emotions. Narrating a personal story can work wonders as the audience can relate to it on an individual level. Think about some stand-out examples of human stories that relate to your business so that people can connect with the central character.</p><p>Here, Nike – one of the top brands in the world encourages women around the world to fulfill their dreams. Be it gender inequality or playing soccer, it asks women to do what they want.</p><h4 id="3-Ask-Questions-or-Have-a-Q-A-Session"><a href="#3-Ask-Questions-or-Have-a-Q-A-Session" class="headerlink" title="3.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&amp;A Session"></a>3.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&amp;A Session</h4><p>Do you wish to get the audience involved? Ask questions right away! Questions and Q&amp;A sessions break up the regular presentation rhythm and help in marking whatever you say as important. This way, you can turn your presentation from a boring activity into an active quest that your audience loves exploring on their own through answers.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Visual-Metaphors"><a href="#4-Use-Visual-Metaphors" class="headerlink" title="4.  Use Visual Metaphors"></a>4.  Use Visual Metaphors</h4><p>Texts are less memorable and combining visuals with your message can help you grab the attention of the audience during your presentation. Visual metaphors are an excellent way to use images. In fact, visual images of situations that people are already familiar with help retain points much longer in their memory.</p><h4 id="5-Add-Music"><a href="#5-Add-Music" class="headerlink" title="5.  Add Music"></a>5.  Add Music</h4><p>Music has the power to enhance and support emotions in video presentations, as well as proven to sustain the attention of people and help in information retention. As per the <a class="link"   href="https://www.ronberk.com/articles/2011%5Fresearch.pdf" >research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of The John Hopkins University’s Ronald A. Berk, <em>“Music embedded throughout a PowerPoint presentation can sustain attention while slipping the content into long-term memory.”</em> Incorporating music is one of the most amazing video presentation ideas you can take inspiration from.</p><h4 id="6-Break-It-Up-With-Humorous-Memes"><a href="#6-Break-It-Up-With-Humorous-Memes" class="headerlink" title="6.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes"></a>6.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes</h4><p>You’ve seen memes everywhere and you might even be sick of them. But, that doesn’t mean memes cannot be useful. In fact, using memes strategically can not only make your audience laugh but also surprise them.</p><h4 id="7-Add-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#7-Add-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="7.  Add Motion Graphics"></a>7.  Add Motion Graphics</h4><p>Motion graphics are an excellent way to illustrate an innovative idea with animated objects. When you add motion graphics in your presentation, it captures people’s attention instantly.</p><p>The video above shows how you can use motion graphics on the English alphabets.</p><h4 id="8-Use-Quotes-between-Slides"><a href="#8-Use-Quotes-between-Slides" class="headerlink" title="8.  Use Quotes between Slides"></a>8.  Use Quotes between Slides</h4><p>Quotes can be great breathers between groups of informative slides. You can either use quotes to start new sections of information or to separate ideas inside your video presentation. Make sure that the quotes you are using represent the topic of your presentation. This way, you can be confident they will make complete sense and not leave the viewers confused.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-quotes-between-slides.jpg"                      alt="Quotes between Slides"                ></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> &lt;<a href="http://www.behance.net>">www.behance.net&gt;</a></p><h4 id="9-Add-an-Audio-Narration"><a href="#9-Add-an-Audio-Narration" class="headerlink" title="9.  Add an Audio Narration"></a>9.  Add an Audio Narration</h4><p>No matter how long or short your presentation is, narration can give it a completely different mood, especially if the words are heartfelt and the voice is powerful. Use the voice to change the pace or tone of your presentation and it will keep the audience to your video. Furthermore, adding an audio narrative into your slideshow can be an excellent way to create an interactive presentation experience.</p><h4 id="10-Play-with-Animations-and-Transitions"><a href="#10-Play-with-Animations-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="10.  Play with Animations and Transitions"></a>10.  Play with Animations and Transitions</h4><p>One of the greatest advantages of videos over the standard presentations is that you can do all kinds of trendy things. Animations and transitions can pull your audience in and help you bring focus to crucial areas and ensure that viewers engage with you. Video content lets you condense complex ideas in seconds, the video below from <a class="link"   href="https://www.yumyumvideos.com/" >Yum Yum Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows how to deliver messages in a compelling and empathetic way with explainer videos.</p><h4 id="11-Turn-Your-Slides-into-a-Scrolling-Infographic"><a href="#11-Turn-Your-Slides-into-a-Scrolling-Infographic" class="headerlink" title="11.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic"></a>11.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic</h4><p>Line up your slides vertically for creating a scrolling infographic rather than a classic slide by slide transition presentation. When the viewer scrolls down, the information fills every slide progressively. In fact, this technique is ideal for displaying video presentations online.</p><h4 id="12-End-On-A-Meaningful-Strong-Note"><a href="#12-End-On-A-Meaningful-Strong-Note" class="headerlink" title="12.  End On A Meaningful &amp; Strong Note"></a>12.  End On A Meaningful &amp; Strong Note</h4><p>Looking for unique video presentation ideas that appeal to the audience? Your presentation will give you a lasting positive impression only if you end it right. It’s crucial to let the audience know what you want them to do next – visit a website, ponder an idea, or to take action towards a definite goal.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Visually-Striking-Video-Presentations"><a href="#How-to-Create-Visually-Striking-Video-Presentations" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Visually Striking Video Presentations?"></a>How to Create Visually Striking Video Presentations?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a powerful video editing software that’s used for creating video attention-grabbing video presentations.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-Asper’s-Methodology-for-Sleep-Success"><a href="#Navigating-Asper’s-Methodology-for-Sleep-Success" class="headerlink" title="Navigating Asper’s Methodology for Sleep Success"></a>Navigating Asper’s Methodology for Sleep Success</h2><p>What is ASMR, and <strong>why does ASMR make you sleepy</strong>? Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) sufferers report the sensation as extremely calming, with a static feeling over the head, back of the neck, shoulders, and sometimes elsewhere in the body. People have likened it and connected it to the frisson or shivers many experiences while listening to music. On the other hand, ASMR is elicited by crisp or quiet noises, either alone or in combination with conservative movement or personal attention. Some ASMR-inducing films incorporate visual clues, which seem to influence the reactions of some individuals.</p><p>Whether you’ve used ASMR to help you sleep in the past or you love its potential advantages, it’s worth researching how it works and the best <strong>ASMR for sleep</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-1.jpg"                      alt="asmr for sleep"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-does-ASMR-help-you-sleep"><a href="#Part-1-Why-does-ASMR-help-you-sleep" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?"></a>Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?</h2><p>Due to the recent discovery of <strong>ASMR sleep videos</strong>, research into its mechanism is still in its infancy. Researchers have assumptions about how ASMR works, and the conducted research gives fascinating data.</p><p>Researchers did <a class="link"   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6209833/" >fMRI brain scans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on participants experiencing ASMR in one investigation. During the ASMR tingle, participants in the research demonstrated activity across their brains, known as whole brain activation. There was also intense activity in the brain region involved with self-awareness, social comprehension, and social movements in nonhuman primates, including grooming behaviors. Because the effects of <strong>ASMR for sleep</strong> are comparable to those of social grooming in monkeys, the researchers hypothesized that it might be a grooming response that survived evolution.</p><p>So, <strong>does ASMR help you sleep</strong>? Let us find the answer in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p>ASMR is a social reaction, which explains why it increases feelings of comfort, relaxation, and drowsiness. ASMR engages brain parts connected with chemicals such as dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins, which may boost these experiences. It may also explain why some personality traits, particularly openness to new experiences, seem to enhance the likelihood of someone having ASMR.</p><p>ASMR, on the other hand, maybe more sophisticated than this idea predicts. While most individuals who experience ASMR find it calming, it also tends to cause heightened excitement and non-sexual physiological arousal. Nostalgia is a complicated experience that could be both pleasant and sad, and ASMR may be a complex reaction that is both relaxing and exciting. ASMR links with brain connectivity. According to one research, persons with it have diminished functional connectivity or a typical connection in particular brain parts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-2.jpg"                      alt="asmr help you sleep"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-ASMR-Channels-for-Sleep"><a href="#Part-2-Best-ASMR-Channels-for-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best ASMR Channels for Sleep"></a>Part 2: Best ASMR Channels for Sleep</h2><p>Although not everyone, most individuals tend to experience ASMR for the first time between the ages of 5 and 10, though some people experience it later in life.

Even silent phone vibrations might disrupt sleep. (30 dB might interrupt sleep) Even if you don’t wake up, it may create a lighter sleep period, leaving you unrested. Before bed, set “do not disturb.” During the stated time, it mutes calls, emails, and notifications—no ringing or buzzing. The content continues without warning. In an emergency, you may customize the mode to accept specific calls.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-8.jpg"                      alt="turn off notification"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-YouTube-autoplay"><a href="#2-Turn-off-YouTube-autoplay" class="headerlink" title="2.

When you turn on autoplay, the following relevant video in the playlist will begin playing automatically when the previous video finishes playing. It continues playing videos, so you don’t have to choose a new video to view once the one you’re watching stops playing. To maximize <strong>ASMR sleep</strong>, you can switch off autoplay and avoid the discomfort of having to search for the back button to halt unwanted music frantically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-9.jpg"                      alt="turn off youtube auto play"                ></p><h3 id="3-Stop-finding-the-best-sleeping-position-and-focus-on-the-ASMR"><a href="#3-Stop-finding-the-best-sleeping-position-and-focus-on-the-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="3.

Even silent phone vibrations might disrupt sleep. (30 dB might interrupt sleep) Even if you don’t wake up, it may create a lighter sleep period, leaving you unrested. Before bed, set “do not disturb.” During the stated time, it mutes calls, emails, and notifications—no ringing or buzzing. The content continues without warning.

They prefer to watch videos as opposed to reading text-based review. The demand for good review is high with companies and business looking to get reviews of their product on YouTube through popular reviewer.</p><p>YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google and has a billion users a month. This makes YouTube an attractive platform to post product reviews and build trust with consumers.</p><p>Good product review videos give that last push to your potential customers to buy the product you are endorsing. Lastly feedback from these reviews will help your viewers to either purchase or not.</p><p>Product review video creation thus became profitable career for many, so in this article will guide you to create excellent products review channel.</p><p>When creating a YouTube channel, you need to make sure that you have all the equipment needed to start making the content you have chosen which is the product review video. If you are really determined to create one, you don’t need to buy expensive vlogging equipment right away, you can use what you have now if the video is clear and the audio is good.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video"><a href="#What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video" class="headerlink" title="What are the things needed to make a quality video?"></a>What are the things needed to make a quality video?</h2><p><strong>Camera for video:</strong> If you only have your smart phone, that’s good to go if the video is working</p><p><strong>Good Lighting:</strong> Open window for the natural sunlight to come in, better to make video around 8am to 10am you will get the good sunlight that time. But there is affordable ring light in the online shop that you can purchased. Most content creator use right light for steady light and proper video lighting</p><p><strong>Stand&#x2F;Tripod:</strong> Tripod used if you have digital camera and you can use phone stand for your mobile phone for steady video. There is also affordable stand that you can buy online</p><p><strong>Lapel Microphone:</strong> Use lapel microphone that can be connected even if you are using mobile phone for vlogging. This can make your audio quality good and clear.</p><p><strong>Place&#x2F;Studio:</strong> Find extra space in your room where you can sit to vlog properly. Also look for a good background, one that doesn’t grab the viewers’ attention much better to use plain background.</p><p><strong>Products:</strong> Products that you will make a review, the one that you think you can stand until the end. Like for example you can change the brand of the products but you should stick to that type of product, like if you want to talk about Tech then you will do all reviews about Tech, if it’s about skin care product then all the reviews should also be done about skin care.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/things-to-prepare-product-review-video.jpg"                      alt="things to prepare product review video"                ></p><h2 id="Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel"><a href="#Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Things to consider to start Product Review Channel"></a>Things to consider to start Product Review Channel</h2><h3 id="Create-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Create-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Create a YouTube Channel"></a><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong></h3><p>Before you do a product review, you need to create a YouTube channel where you can post the product review videos you made. There you can get paid for the videos you made thru Google Adsense when your channel is Monetized. But if you’re just starting out, don’t think that you’ll make money right away, because it’s not that easy. Before you can earn on YouTube you must first pass the requirements that YouTube asks for you to become a partner, it is to have 1,000 Subscriber and 4,000 watch hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/select-right-product-to-review.jpg"                      alt="select right product to review"                ></p><p>However, it’s important to note that even from there, YouTube will still evaluate your channel for other strict criteria to make sure it is complying with all their policies and best practices outside of watch time and watch hours minimums.</p><p>For now, just do you job and create a quality video to soon be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/results-of-qulaity-product-video.jpg"                      alt="results of qulaity product video"                ></p><h3 id="Kind-of-Products-to-Review"><a href="#Kind-of-Products-to-Review" class="headerlink" title="Kind of Products to Review"></a><strong>Kind of Products to Review</strong></h3><p>Start by reviewing products you have, because nobody is going to give out a free product to someone who’s never uploaded a review. Of course, it’s important from the starts you really need to invest in the product you want to review, so you can start a video reviewing product on your channel if that’s the content you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/decide-product-review-type.jpg"                      alt="decide product review type"                ></p><p>For the Brand to notice your video, buy some of their products that you think useful to you and make a review about it, make sure to make a video review creative to stands out to another reviewer. So that when the Brands see your video they will be amazed by at your work. But just make sure that the product your reviewing is approved to or you don’t have any issue with the products, because remember it’s not just the Brand eyeing to your work but the viewers are also looking for such a review.</p><p>When you have a lot of product review video on you channel, other Brands will approach you to offer you to do a review on their product and sometime they also offer payment. But they only offer the payment when they think it’s worth it or they get some sales. In regard with this I’m talking about your community or Subscribers count, because Brands only offer payment for your video if you have stable or more subscribers’ count. So, if you don’t have many subscribers yet, you need to work hard to increase your viewers and patient is more important in this kind of field.</p><p>I recommend sticking with the same kind of products and specialize so that the viewers will familiar that you are the one doing that kind of review. They know immediately whose channel they should search of they ever need your review.</p><h3 id="Script-about-the-Products"><a href="#Script-about-the-Products" class="headerlink" title="Script about the Products"></a><strong>Script about the Products</strong></h3><p>Here is some basic information on how you make a quality script</p><ol><li>The basic information about the products example the price, size, ingredients and or materials</li><li>Where you got</li><li>What you liked about the products</li><li>What you didn’t like</li><li>Worth to buy or not</li><li>Recommendation or your personal thoughts about the product</li></ol><p>Just like product demo videos, product review videos also need a proper script before recording so that you cover everything that you want to without missing any key aspects of the product that you’re reviewing. Keep the review short and to the point because potential customers have come to your channel to watch the review of the product in the market. Concentrate on the products and explain the features in detail to help users determine if the products suit them. You can add your opinion to humanize the product features. As an Influencer, the main purpose of doing product review is to get people to buy the products you feature. You need to build credibly with customers for them to buy what you recommend. To achieve this, you need to give your genuine review by highlight the pros and cons of the product. This will get you the potential customer or subscriber who will happy to buy the products you are endorsing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Good-Editing"><a href="#Good-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Good Editing"></a><strong>Good Editing</strong></h3><p>Editing is important if you want to look good.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Crafting-Superior-Recordings-A-Guide-to-Audacity"><a href="#Crafting-Superior-Recordings-A-Guide-to-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Crafting Superior Recordings: A Guide to Audacity"></a>Crafting Superior Recordings: A Guide to Audacity</h2><p>Most users choose for Voice Memos on Mac or Sound Recorder on PC when they wish to capture audio on their computer. However, despite the fact that these tools let you record audio using the microphone, they lack the features needed for more sophisticated audio recording and editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Audacity-add-audio.jpg"                      alt="record profeesional audio"                ></p><p>Therefore, the majority of users think of Audacity when they wish to record and edit high-quality audio on their PCs. Most people use this open-source audio recorder as their go-to tool because it is totally free to use.</p><p>However, due to its large and difficult to comprehend interface, the majority of users find it difficult to operate. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to quickly record your desktop using Audacity. Even if you’ve never used Audacity before, the procedures we explain here will make it simple for you to record audio of any length.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Download-the-software"><a href="#1-Download-the-software" class="headerlink" title="1. Download the software"></a>1. Download the software</h2><p>Step1Go to your preferred browser and visit the official <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >https://www.audacityteam.org/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using your preferred web browser.</p><p>Step2All the recording devices on your computer will be displayed in a drop-down menu. Choose the microphone you want to employ for the recording. Make sure the microphone is turned on and properly connected to the computer if you can’t see it.</p><p>Step3To choose the kind of track you want, click “Tracks” at the top of the page and then “Add New”. You can just select “Mono” or “Stereo” for the majority of straightforward projects.</p><p>Step4To begin the recording, simply click the “Record” button. As soon as you press record, an audio graph of your voice should start to display. Using the “Shift + R” hotkeys on your keyboard, you can add a new recording if you’d like to.</p><h2 id="2-Recording-using-Mac"><a href="#2-Recording-using-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Recording using Mac"></a>2. Recording using Mac</h2><p>To record audio on your Mac, you might need to install Audacity and additional plugins. The best option is to use the Soundflower program, which enables you to send sound to other apps rather than your computer’s speakers. Here’s how to use Soundflower and Audacity to record audio on a Mac.</p><p>Step1The first step is to install Soundflower and Audacity on your Mac. It costs nothing to download either of these programs.</p><p>Step2The Soundflower app must then be set up. To achieve this, choose “Sounds” from the “System Preferences” menu. By choosing the Output tab, designate “Soundflower” as the sound output device (2ch). After that, launch the Sunflower app, and select the Flower icon in the menu bar to switch the built-in output to “Soundflower 2ch.”</p><p>Step3In the “Device” section of the Audacity preferences box, choose “Soundflower (2ch)”. From the recording area, choose “Software playthrough.” Click “OK” to save the options you’ve selected.</p><p>Step4Launch audacity, then open the app whose audio you wish to record. To begin the recording, click the “Record” button.</p><h2 id="3-Export-your-audio"><a href="#3-Export-your-audio" class="headerlink" title="3. Export your audio"></a>3. Export your audio</h2><p>It’s time to export the finished file after finishing up your Audacity project’s modification. It’s crucial to realize that simply saving your Audacity project doesn’t produce a file that you can share with others.</p><p>You’ll need to do a process known as exporting in order to produce a file that you can distribute and publish to your podcast host, Spotify, or other audio distribution sites. Fortunately, everything is quite easy. Let’s examine Audacity’s exporting procedure.</p><p>Do the following in Audacity to export audio:</p><ol><li>Activate the file menu</li><li>Then click “Export”</li><li>Choose the solution that best suits your needs</li></ol><p>There are already preset options for.
